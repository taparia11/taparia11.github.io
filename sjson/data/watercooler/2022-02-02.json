Now the idea here would be for everyone to see the updates, so that not only the manager sees everything.\n\nAlso, I like the idea of text async update, in case you cannot come to the meeting.

The company is around 20 people.\n\n1. We do a weekly meeting with the whole team called 'Monday morning meeting' or MMM. Over there we've got themes, so: Product, Marketing, Sales, Design. We usually report what happened last week and what we are going to achieve this week. The meeting has a hard stop of 30 mins and often concludes in 15 mins. The only people talking are the Heads of the departments. \n2. We've got a kind of 'executive meeting' scheduled 3 times per week: Monday, Wednesday, Friday. There is a shared agenda where we write the points we'd like to discuss. If there are no points - we just cancel the meeting. What is important is that this time is *blocked* in our schedule, so if someone needs to discuss something with the other decision makers, they have the opportunity. About 50% of the meetings don't take place. If something doesn't concern your department - you are free to leave the meeting, but nobody does, because it is better to eavesdrop than to be excluded from the conversation. \n3. Finally, I've got *daily standups* with my team - the people that I am responsible for. We get together each morning. This is an extremely important meeting. It kicks off the day for everyone and everyone knows that this is basically.. their last call to actually start working that day (we are fully remote). We have a coffee and discuss the priorities and the tasks for the day (usually happens around 10.30-11AM). People ask for help and then we split into other meeting rooms to collaborate (if needed). This is the time you would spend with your team every day. And you need this quite a lot to set up a remote structure where you build actual relationships with your colleagues. \nFinally, a bit different from those, we've got the quarterly meetings. Each quarter we get together (again some decision-maker meeting) and go over our priorities for the quarter that passed. We analyze, dig deep into the results and try to understand if we under-planned or underestimated something or whatever. This is the most important meeting and its duration is usually 4-5 hours (could be split into 2 days or so). Sounds like a waste of time (and sometimes feel like it during the meeting), but this is the *high level\/eagle eye* whatever view of the business and is where *true priorities are set*.\n\nOnce we've done that, we create a short presentation for the whole team and get them up to speed with whatever was discussed\/decided, share some data, take some time to appreciate everyone's work.",

I've also worked at a fintech and we used our project management tool (Basecamp) to do something similar.\n\nWhat I've found worked best was having two types of updates (both weekly):\n\n1. An overall status update for the person, shared with the entire team. What did you get done last week? What are you going to work on this week? Are you facing any roadblocks? Because the team was somewhat asynchronous, the update request would go out on Monday and people had to reply within 24 hours. As a manager, it was a way for me to keep a general pulse on the team (managing two teams of 6-7 people) and also provided transparency to teammates.\n2. We also did project-level updates, once per week, inside the project management tool. The work was with clients, so the project level update was only for teammates on that project, but talked about any progress, any hurdles, and the client's overall sentiment. The fintech's development team did not use project-level updates, but in retrospect, that likely would have been helpful for long, drawn-out projects.\nHope this helps!",
