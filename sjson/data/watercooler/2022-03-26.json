Just to clarify - am I exempt from tax witholding? Some sources seem to think yes while others say no. The IRS website is a bit confusing but from what I got it seems like as long as a \"personal service\" is not performed within the US, my income for that service isn't classed as US-sourced income and shouldn't be subject to witholding even if the payer is a US company. Am I correct? Thanks for the help!",
