        "text": "<@ULJBEFSJJ> that's a good suggestion, thank you! The challenge I have with that is that I actually already have a UX Designer on the Marketing team (yes.... slightly odd set-up I know...a hire from before my time). Our UX designer is actually responsible for (and great at!) all the back-end coding, but he is not a creative, and so he doesn't have much to work with in terms of creative assets. That's the gap we're trying to fill (along with overall brand identity of course).\n<@U01KYJVARBP>'s question is also interesting, and something I've been asked a couple of times and struggled to put my finger on how to answer. As I'm writing this I'm wondering if it's possibly *because* we already have a UXer in place that I may be struggling to fill the design role. Naturally, with the UXer in place, I've tried to create a clear boundary in terms of designing the Designer job spec to focus on the creative stuff. But this means the profile of applicants tends to be coming from a softer creative side, lots of applicants with experience in B2C, print and experiential stuff; very few with an understanding of B2B software sales trajectories and how buyers behave online. I had web page mock-ups submitted that looked fantastic, but like billboards or posters, if you understand what I mean. I don't expect a designer to understand the marketing stuff at a detailed level but there are certain page design frameworks and best practices that help website visitors instantly understand 'ah, it's a software platform'. If that makes any sense :sweat_smile:",
