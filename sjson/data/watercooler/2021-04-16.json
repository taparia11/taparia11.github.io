        "text": "Hi, Kelly! Would the company where you are now allow you to start cross-training in marketing, creative, or with the web team? Can you talk with someone in HR and see what your opportunities are? I've been at companies where people cross departments, and it usually turns out to be really perfect for the company because they get to retain someone with institutional knowledge. Just make sure you aren't taken advantage of and end up doing two full-time jobs for the same salary. The expectation would be that you have less of your current work load while you are taking on more responsibilities with the other department. Obviously, other options are available, but it might be a decent way to get experience and not violate your company's outside work rule. Good luck!",
