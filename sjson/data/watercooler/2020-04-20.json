They’re designed to help all of us create better routines and habit patterns by integrating yoga, meditation, and self-reflection into our days. They’re based on ancient, scientifically validated methods that connect dots between self-care, productivity, mental clarity, and physical well-being.  These resources are self-paced, affordable, and easy to weave into busy days.\n\nWe spent 3 years building these courses before the pandemic hit. They are now available to the public. You can access them here: <https:\/\/storyhackers.com\/courses>\n\nI was wondering if:\n• Anyone on this group might like a 30% discount code for courses and\n• Anyone in this group might work for companies that have corporate wellness program, that would value purchasing these for employees\nPlease DM me.\n\nStoryhackers is a small business and collective of creative entrepreneurs who are committed to helping others be their best during these difficult times. We have needed to pivot our business model and are working hard to keep each other afloat during this tough time.
