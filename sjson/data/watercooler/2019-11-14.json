        "text": "Hi everyone! For those who don't know me, I'm a freelance writer, storytelling coach, and entrepreneur who lives in San Francisco. I specialize in creating content for complex industries such as security, IT, B2B, financial services, healthcare, and SaaS.\n\nI'm reaching out in case anyone in this group needs content help through EOY or Q1 2020. I have some availability to take on writing work, as I'm about to go live in a forest for two months.\n\nI've worked with dozens of companies, all over the world. I've also worked with federal government innovation teams in deeply technical areas. I love building creative assets across mediums ranging from ebooks, to videos, case studies, and web copy. I operate as a freelancer and team up with fellow freelancers.\n\nYou can see my range of services here. You can see my capabilities list, here: <https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1qwdffyeDjTJCQaegVrESm1jvTcSNqYsvniyjReEDvvc\/edit>\n\nIn addition to my writing and storytelling work, I am building a business that tackles the epidemic of stress and anxiety for young people based on principles of stoic philosophy. My training is in epidemiology, and I've teamed up with a group of medical researchers to build this.\n\nI'm my spare time, I study philosophy and consciousness. I am also writing a comic book, helping launch a podcast, and mentor founders who are transitioning into building businesses.\n\nPlease reach out if you are interested in potentially working together",
