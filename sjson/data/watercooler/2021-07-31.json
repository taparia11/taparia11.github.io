If you don't know what that is, I listen to podcasts before they're released and extract key takeaways from them to put into a blog post, email, description, etc. There is, however, a common theme that I am listening to B2B\/B2C leaders and founders talking on major podcasts. I'd like to explore other niches\/types of audiences in this particular line of work - something like this in Tennis would be ideal. How can I use my experience to apply to such jobs and more importantly, where can I find such jobs in a fully remote capacity?",
