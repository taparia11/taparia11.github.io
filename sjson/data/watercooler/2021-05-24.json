So many of us have experience supporting friends, family — and even ourselves through these terrifyingly close calls with mortality. Cancer rates are on the rise globally. A recent (2015) study in the British Journal of Cancer forecasts that 1 in 2 American women and 1 in 3 American men will develop cancer in the lifetimes.\n\nTo add a bit of context, I am a rare cancer survivor and lifelong patient with a mother who is currently going through diagnosis and treatment herself. As a demographic researcher, my goal is to bring more awareness to often underrepresented cancer stories — the moments of joy, self discovery, strength, and even profound pain. Personally, it was a sense of community that got me through my own survival journey.\n\nI was wondering if anyone in this group may be willing to sit with me for a 45-minute recorded audio interview. My goal is to simply listen and learn, to identify exactly how I can bring more attention to the untold stories that need surfacing.\n\nMy larger goal is to help organizations create more sustainable and healthy workplace practices. So many of us suffer and risk our livelihoods due to these forces that we cannot control.\n\nIf you comment on this post, I will reach out about the best way to follow up.
