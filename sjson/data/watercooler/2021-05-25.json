Even if there are extensive rewrites involved, refreshes still need to preserve parts of the original content. Hard to define that.\n\nWhat’s consistent (for our agency, anyway), is that no matter if we’re doing a new or refreshed piece of content, we always start with a target keyword. That keyword informs all of our research processes for new _and_ refreshed content. So it makes sense to us to treat everything as one price (for new or existing content, again, because the processes are generally the same).\n\nFor one-off refresh deliverables, I’m inclined to work with our stakeholder to make estimates if a blog doesn’t warrant an entire rewrite, and rather, some improvements to formatting, an additional graf, and internal links.
