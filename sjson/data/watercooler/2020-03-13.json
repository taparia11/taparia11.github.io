My head has been very much in this space as we cancelled a big event lineup and refunded...so much ticket revenue....I wanted to share a few things I'm thinking about\/observing. I would <em>love<\/em> to hear what others think.<br><br>The big one is this: <strong>let's think about people, not clicks. <\/strong><br><br>Here's where I'm coming from...<br><br>We have a pretty large Slack community around our product, and a few people in the group started talking about arranging Zoom checkins with each other. People are alienated and anxious <em>all day<\/em> right now, but they're still working and looking to other people in their industry for support. <br><br>We opened up a new Slack channel with one of our partners across the company. The energy in that space feels so good as we plan how to work together and commiserate (How does it feel where you are??). This is a company we've been working with for a long time, but for <em>some reason<\/em> now feels the right time to get a little closer (on Slack, not IRL! :mask:)<br><br>We're trying to figure out how to shift a two-day, in-person training program to a multi-day online program. I contacted a former co-worker who runs a ton of Zoom trainings and he got on a call with my team to give us advice on how to do this really well. It was so.fun.<br><br>Our CEO has made it abundantly clear that everyone's productivity is going to suffer during this time and that is OK. We should be focusing on caring for our families and community. We're all a little less busy, a little more focused on the things that really matter. A lot more...tense. <br><br>All of these things have made it clear to me that this is the time to be connecting with people. <strong>If you're thinking about how to use this time to generate clicks for your blog, you have completely missed the  point. <\/strong>We are all unusually vulnerable right now. Use this time to be honest, unpolished, supportive. To your friends, family, and also your customers and work community.<br><br>Have long, rambling calls with co-workers. Be unproductive. Care for the people you love. Catch up with that old mentor. Brainstorm with a partner. Invite your customers to an informal chat with your product manager. Give yourself space to do work that's just less...markety.<br><br>This is a community I'm looking forward to hearing more from over the coming weeks as I try to do my job and manage my own anxiety (omg, we're closing on a house in two weeks...how is that for bad timing?!). <br><br>Stay safe &amp; healthy :heart:<br>~Janessa<\/p>",
