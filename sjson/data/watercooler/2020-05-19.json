Like you, my default is \"aggressive editor\", but I'd like to think that part of that aggression lies in getting the best of my writers and making sure they're using their skills to the best of their abilities. To that end, so much of it has to do with setting expectations at the beginning, in my experience. Being very honest w\/ a new writer that I'm tough on words and passionate about a good story, so I come off as intense, but I promise I'm working for their good and the good of the piece. And building trust both ways. I ask them to trust me, and I have to trust them. So if I read just a real, \"WTF\" sentence or piece, I have to trust the writer had a good idea in mind, or there's a seed of something there, I just have to talk with them about it to get to the right words. And, worst case scenario, if a writer just isn't working out (very rare this has happened) being honest about that, too. Try and help them down a path or towards a different publication that's a better fit.",

Like you, my default is \"aggressive editor\", but I'd like to think that part of that aggression lies in getting the best of my writers and making sure they're using their skills to the best of their abilities. To that end, so much of it has to do with setting expectations at the beginning, in my experience. Being very honest w\/ a new writer that I'm tough on words and passionate about a good story, so I come off as intense, but I promise I'm working for their good and the good of the piece. And building trust both ways. I ask them to trust me, and I have to trust them. So if I read just a real, \"WTF\" sentence or piece, I have to trust the writer had a good idea in mind, or there's a seed of something there, I just have to talk with them about it to get to the right words. And, worst case scenario, if a writer just isn't working out (very rare this has happened) being honest about that, too. Try and help them down a path or towards a different publication that's a better fit."
