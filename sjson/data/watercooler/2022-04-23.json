How do you go about structuring a kind of a 'pitch deck' to send out to potential sponsors? Any examples you're willing to share?\n\nI'm helping some friends out find some dough for their street art festival. Basically, they find and bring street art artists, sand sculptors, and kite enthusiasts to our little seaside town. No one here makes any money as the festival is not commercial in nature. Still, it's a huge thing for our little community and this is its 7th year running. They're hoping this will be the first year they manage to cover all their expenses without taking a personal financial hit, so they tagged me in to put together something for them. I guess I'm here looking for some inspiration. :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nThey're doing great work on the creative front, btw. You can check out some of the previous art here to get an idea of what kind of a thing it is: <http:\/\/shorturl.at\/hoIVX|shorturl.at\/hoIVX>\n\nTIA",
