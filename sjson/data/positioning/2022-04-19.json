Back at that time, Siebel dominated the enterprise CRM market with hundreds of millions in revenue. Janna Systems couldn't really compete with them and during sales pitches, everyone asked them how Janna was better than Siebel (it wasn't). \n    ◦ They once identified that their software had a unique feature that could model relationships based on people regardless of their companies they worked at and no other CRMs at that time offered this feature (identifying the uniqueness) People at Janna didn't understand the value of this particular feature and it was often perceived less valuable. \n    ◦ They once pitched it to Goldman Sachs and this feature particularly stood out. They recognized that bankers dig this feature (identifying best-fit customers) and Janna proceeded to re-position themselves as \"Enterprise CRM for investment bankers\", their long-term plan was to target the entire banking market and sell their product to them. \n    ◦ They grew from $2M in revenue to more than $80M. Janna ended up getting acquired by Siebel Systems for $1.2bn.\n    ◦ *Key Takeaways*\n        ▪︎ It's easier to start with a narrow marke focus and expand from there.\n        ▪︎ You need good positioning to do good marketing and sales.\n        ▪︎ Strong positioning gives you the ability to position your competitors (you could have the power to change the perceived value of competitor products in the eyes of potential customers)\n",
