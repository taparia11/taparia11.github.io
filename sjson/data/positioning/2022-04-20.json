It leads to customer confusion.\n    ◦ *How to overcome misalignment?*\n        ▪︎ Make it a team sport.\n            • No single team should be responsible for positioning a product.\n            • Have representatives available from different departments during discussion. From product management to marketing, sales, and even the top-level executives if possible.\n        ▪︎ Have a shared language.\n            • Start with the basics. Make sure everyone's on the same page about the definitions of the terms you're using.\n        ▪︎ Let go of the past\n            • People who've positioned and worked on the product till now may have a hard time letting go of their idea of what the product is.\n            • Make sure people are ready to think of the product in a newer way.\n        ▪︎ Gain access of customer data\n            • We need sales people in the room who can speak about how a customer makes a purchase decision. The data should be available ahead of time.\n            • What data to look for?\n                ◦ Who are the customers?\n                ◦ What other products do they consider before they buy yours?\n                ◦ Why do they buy your product?\n    ◦ *Key Learnings*\n        ▪︎ Alignment is a hard won prize.\n        ▪︎ What you feed into the process determines what you get out of it.\n        ▪︎ Necessary knowledge may be available within your organization - the right process can extract it from different teams.\n• Your Uniqueness\n    ◦ Strong positioning is centered and makes your product unique.\n    ◦ Mapping out uniqueness\n        ▪︎ *Competitive Alternatives*\n            • We think of competitor alternatives as products customers can choose if not ours. A better way to think of this is by questioning what exactly the customer would do if our product didn't exist. This is a broader way of thinking about competitive alternatives.\n            • To discover the uniqueness of your product, you need to understand what you're positioning yourself against.\n            • You'll discover that there are more competitors than what the media displays. Example: A person could replace a CRM software with an Excel sheet or WhatsApp to take notes, save links.\n        ▪︎ *Unique Attributes*\n            • List your unique attributes.\n            • What have you got that the competitors don't?\n            • It can include features such as different pricing model, patent on some technology.\n            • Start by listing the characteristics of your product and then compare to competitive alternatives.\n            • Focus on differences more than how they're value. Just the features you individually have.\n",
