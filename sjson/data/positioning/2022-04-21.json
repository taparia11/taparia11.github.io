What is it that they specifically care about?\n    ◦ The clearer your differentiated value, the easier it is to identify characteristics of customers who'd care about the value you can provide.\n    ◦ \"Our product is for companies who've just raised series B or C funding\" \"Our product is for companies who've X amount of sales turnover\" \"Our product is for people with multiple day jobs\"\n    ◦ *Common mistakes*\n        ▪︎ Segmenting based on unmeasurable characteristics.\n            • Example: \"Our best-fit customers are the ones who want to become healthy\"\n            • A better way to approach this would be \"Our best-fit customers are the ones who've subscribed to these few fitness-based email newsletters, YouTube channels\"\n        ▪︎ Creating personas of people who don't drive the decision-making process.\n    ◦ The segmentation needs to be practical and specific enough that you know who to contact for selling the product.\n• Market Category\n    ◦ Some companies try to sell products by categorizing them into a space that's really competitive whereas they'd be better off positioning it as a sub-segment of a larger space.\n    ◦ You could have a product with a differentiator that's super valuable to people but without other features that the other products in the same category have, in that case, it's hard to convince a customer why they should buy your solution. Instead, position it such that the customers know exactly what and what not to expect from it.\n    ◦ Find a right market category. You can use the following strategies.\n        ▪︎ Big fish, small pond - There's a large enough market but you don't aim to win all of it but rather just a piece of it and then gradually expand. You start with a niche problem solver that the large competitors aren't solving very well.\n        ▪︎ Head to head - It's when you directly go head to head with other companies offering similar solutions. Difficult to achieve without substantial amount of capital. It's advised when there's no clear market leader. It becomes a capture-the-flag where the flag is still up for grabs and you have other competitors trying to get that flag before you.\n        ▪︎ New game - You establish a new category but it requires a lot of teaching and awareness to build upon.\n            • A new market category starts by recognizing that the existing market categories can't provide your product the context that it needs.\n            • Creating a new category requires deep commitment.\n            • Creating a new category isn't just about slapping a new name.\n",
