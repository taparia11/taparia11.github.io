A straight up Golden Girls meme? A few serious tweets? Or just solid prose that understands how to pace and break grammar rules for effect?\n• *Voice conviction:* how do you sound authorative without being pushy? Are you drawing on a source, experience, research, superlatives, history... a blend? \nI could go on. The nuance of excellent written communication is something AI cannot achieve today. It's using very smart and complex algos to make sentences _intelligible_, not _well-written_.\n\nSo you have to ask yourself: should we be investing in producing content that ain't well-written? Just \"passable-ish?\" It might work, if your clients just need wordcount to fill stuff up and you're willing to pass the AI draft to some good editors that can smooth it out. Or maybe the target audiences are not English as a first language, and the AI baseline stuff is 'good enough' for whatever strategy is at hand.\n\nAnywho, if AI can process the subtleties of human emotion via written word well enough to be more cost effective than a good human writer, I believe we'll have bigger issues at hand... namely the whole _\"oh shit we've achieved General AI, is Super AI already here? uh oh civilization as we know is about to get WEIRD\"_ (<https:\/\/medium.com\/mapping-out-2050\/distinguishing-between-narrow-ai-general-ai-and-super-ai-a4bc44172e22>)\n\n^ (Per that article's definition, ALL content AI stuff is firmly 'Narrow AI')",
