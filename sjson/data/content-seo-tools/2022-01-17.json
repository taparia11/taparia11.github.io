The reason was that I \"cost too much\" and the other agency said they could \"do SEO\" for less - but this other agency is only changing meta tags and not creating any new content. My strategy involved all the things, from content audit\/comp analysis\/keyword strategy\/content rewrites\/and all the other on-page techniques - including updating the metas. My question here is...is there such a thing as just a \"metadata strategy\" that, on its own can have an incredible impact on your SEO in terms of ranking? I've never heard of offering metas as a standalone service, and I always packaged\/completed them as a natural part of SEO keyword\/content work...but to offer these just on their own...without any new content\/keyword strategy or anything.  Is this a thing? Thoughts?",

Timing is everything in sales and if they realize that they are getting no results from the other agency's work, then they'll be on the lookout for another one to work with.\n\nTo <@U01881ZL1B6>'s point, talking about ROI is a very powerful part of the sales process and will often help you stand out in the SEO world where everyone focuses only on traffic and rankings. Talking about ROI is speaking their language rather than making them speak our language. I work with B2B and B2C lead gen companies (think home services, managed IT services, etc) and always ask the following questions:\n• What is your AOV (average order value) and CLV (customer lifetime value)?\n• What is your CAC (customer acquisition cost) goal?\n• what are your leads and sales goals from SEO?\nWhen you ask these questions you accomplish a few things:\n1. Identify what kind of client you're dealing with.\n2. Position yourself as an authority.\n3. Stand out from most other SEOs.\n4. Show the client you care that they make money by working with you.\n5. Turn the expense of SEO into an investment.\n6. Calculate what SEO is worth to them.\n7. Set realistic expectations.\n1. I find that clients fall into one of a few categories. (1) They've never thought about any of the questions you're asking. This is usually a small business owner and often not the greatest client. You should price accordingly because they will take up more of your time by asking lots of questions and requiring more hand holding. (2) They're a startup and don't have answers because they don't yet have data. If they have previous business experience, they may at least know what you're talking about. (3) The most sophisticated clients, and always the best clients, know their numbers. All else equal, these are the clients you should go above and beyond to close because they are savvy business people who will grow faster and larger than other clients and if you are doing good work for them, they will keep you with them and often increase their budgets with you.\n\n2-5. This is all about the psychology of sales. Years ago I held two different jobs in sales, both in home security. The first was  door to door sales. Anytime I'd knock on a door, I was immediately placed into the \"sales person\" bucket by the homeowner. Overcoming this perspective was doable, but hard. The homeowner didn't trust me much and thought that anything that came out of my mouth was intended to sell them something. The other job I had was as a home security technician. I would either be installing a home security system or fixing one. When I stepped into a customer's home, making a sale was 10x easier than when I was a door to door rep. One of the biggest reasons for this was because the customer viewed me as an authority on the topic of home security, not as a sales rep. They listened to my suggestions and trusted my advice. When you the  questions above and talk about how the client is going to make money by working with you, you can reposition yourself as the technician instead of the sales rep.\n\n6. When you calculate what SEO is worth to them, it makes your price point more digestible. When a client says they want 10 sales per month from SEO and each sale is worth $1,000 to them, that's $10,000. All of the sudden, your $2,500 price point doesn't seem so bad. For clients who have done SEO and know the value of the channel, this is less important. For those just venturing into SEO seriously, this is an important step.\n\n7. Some clients have wildly unrealistic expectations of ROI or don't know what to expect. By doing the math, you can set realistic expectations.",

This is usually a small business owner and often not the greatest client. You should price accordingly because they will take up more of your time by asking lots of questions and requiring more hand holding. (2) They're a startup and don't have answers because they don't yet have data. If they have previous business experience, they may at least know what you're talking about. (3) The most sophisticated clients, and always the best clients, know their numbers. All else equal, these are the clients you should go above and beyond to close because they are savvy business people who will grow faster and larger than other clients and if you are doing good work for them, they will keep you with them and often increase their budgets with you.\n\n2-5. This is all about the psychology of sales. Years ago I held two different jobs in sales, both in home security. The first was  door to door sales. Anytime I'd knock on a door, I was immediately placed into the \"sales person\" bucket by the homeowner. Overcoming this perspective was doable, but hard. The homeowner didn't trust me much and thought that anything that came out of my mouth was intended to sell them something. The other job I had was as a home security technician. I would either be installing a home security system or fixing one. When I stepped into a customer's home, making a sale was 10x easier than when I was a door to door rep. One of the biggest reasons for this was because the customer viewed me as an authority on the topic of home security, not as a sales rep. They listened to my suggestions and trusted my advice. When you the  questions above and talk about how the client is going to make money by working with you, you can reposition yourself as the technician instead of the sales rep.\n\n6. When you calculate what SEO is worth to them, it makes your price point more digestible. When a client says they want 10 sales per month from SEO and each sale is worth $1,000 to them, that's $10,000. All of the sudden, your $2,500 price point doesn't seem so bad. For clients who have done SEO and know the value of the channel, this is less important. For those just venturing into SEO seriously, this is an important step.\n\n7. Some clients have wildly unrealistic expectations of ROI or don't know what to expect. By doing the math, you can set realistic expectations."
