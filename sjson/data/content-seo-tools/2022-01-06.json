I’m trying to give people customized results after they take the quiz and have assigned a point value to each answer. If they score in one range, they get a message that says they may not be ready for my product. If they score something else then they get a message that says they are ready blah blah. But right now bc I assigned a point value to the questions, the summary makes it look like they got only a certain percentage right or wrong versus just a total number of points to see the results message. Does anybody know survey monkey well enough to suggest a way to have people take a quiz and see their results that don’t make them feel like they only got 50% “right or wrong” at the end bc there are no wrong answers. We’re just trying to gauge where they are as far as ready for our product or not and or could benefit from it ",
