We were using airtable to manage all content initiatives, but our business switched to Jira as part of the move to Agile this year which meant that we were left to manually update both platforms (and naturally fell off updating Airtable regularly as a result).\n\nI find Airtable more suited to our natural workflow, but need to upkeep Jira for business visibility.
