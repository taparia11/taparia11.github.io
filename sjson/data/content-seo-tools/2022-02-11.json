It slides in from the side of Chrome where you can search and find the info you're looking for.\n\n*Easy to Keep Updated*\n———\nYou can set periods for each card that indicate how often it should be reviewed and verified to be up to date. People can also flag a card as being out of date if there’s an issue. They can add comments, etc. to help whoever’s responsible keep things updated. If you don't mind letting anyone\/everyone update things, it has logs at the card level you can review to see who\/what changed.\n\n\n*Keeping People Up to Date*\n———\nYou can send out alerts for people when something changes that you want them to be aware of. Along with logs of who’s viewed the changes.\n\n*Knowledge Triggers*\n———\nThis is really cool but niche. You can create these knowledge triggers that will look for a specific element on a page that causes a little nudge to trigger to let you know there’s a relevant knowledge card you might want to view. We use these for very specific things we’ve seen get continually messed up, new things we roll out we want folks to get more familiar with, and for new hires who are onboarding and training.\n\n*Related Cards*\n———\nGuru will automatically recommend related cards at the bottom of cards once it begins to notice a pattern. It bases that on prior user behavior (e.g. other cards people who view this card tend to view next\/prior and such).\n\n*Works Great with Freelancers\/Customers*\n———\nYou can make the cards publicly accessible as read only. Great for customers who don’t have the Chrome extension but need support. Even better for freelancers who download the Chrome extension and get the additional benefits from reducing context switching (oh, and you can have unlimited read-only users for free—great if you work with a lot of freelancers).\n\nYou can embed cards in Notion, on the web, or wherever else as well. It works with Slack to quickly find info using \/ commands. You can create cards from within Slack too. \n\nThere’s a lot more. Hopefully this is enough. \n\nFYI: I don’t work with Guru or have any affiliation with them. This is just what my customer feedback looks like when a product solves a major headache for me haha.",

Even better for freelancers who download the Chrome extension and get the additional benefits from reducing context switching (oh, and you can have unlimited read-only users for free—great if you work with a lot of freelancers).\n\nYou can embed cards in Notion, on the web, or wherever else as well. It works with Slack to quickly find info using \/ commands. You can create cards from within Slack too. \n\nThere’s a lot more. Hopefully this is enough. \n\nFYI: I don’t work with Guru or have any affiliation with them. This is just what my customer feedback looks like when a product solves a major headache for me haha."
