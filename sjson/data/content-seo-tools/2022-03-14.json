        "text": "Hey <@U021Z1Z85GT> - We have been using Asana for several years for PM stuff, but have found it difficult to use for multi-channel calendar management - especially for folks that are not involved in the day to day. Perhaps other folks have made it work but we struggled.\n\nBut, with that said - within Asana I would start with a board view and create sections for each of your channels (blogs, social, email, etc). Then use the due date to assign the dates you want the activities to show in the calendar. For the folks that are not executing, they will probably get more benefit using the calendar view since it is more visual. You'll probably need the paid version to allow for color coding tasks and creating custom fields (subject lines, audience, etc)\n\nOther options - we actually built a tool to solve this problem because there were not a lot of tools that we found were easy to use and adopt (it's called <http:\/\/Promoprep.com|PromoPrep>). It's more focused on the calendar view and less about task management, so it can be easier to adopt and use with less initial setup.\n\nAnother option is <http:\/\/coschedule.com|CoSchedule> - it's more complex, but it has hooks into social channels and blog platforms (it's a bit more focused on execution, but has a lot of planning functions too). Sorry to not answer this question directly and introduce different tools - but if you're already struggling to adopt Asana, it might be an easier route to take.",
