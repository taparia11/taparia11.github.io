For now, I'm using a spreadsheet for high-level planning (but I don't call it anything near as clever as Blog Log), with one sheet dedicated to each major content pillar.\n\nFor production, I use Asana's kanban board structure, pushing each piece through stages to completion. My stages are Backlog (Ideas), In Writing, In Review, To Be Published, To Be Promoted, Done.\n\nI also use tags to differentiate things a bit further, but by content type, not topic (that would be too crazy). Asana tasks are nice because you can assign subtasks and tag folks for input. You should be able to do all of the above in the free version.",
