I use it to create content, save my files and deliver to clients. There are resources on their blog that give you an idea of how the platform works\n\nIt's pretty convenient. I don't need to use Gdocs or Drive anymore. They are upgrading features frequently so it'll probably get better with time.\n\nI signed up about 4 months ago and they had an offer of 6-months free access. Not sure if the offer is still there, but it's worth checking out.",
