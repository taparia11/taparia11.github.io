I’m Jérémy, a Notion Ambassador who has built some pretty cool stuff on Notion, including a school and many templates beyond this one.I built this template for myself, while creating SEO-focused content for a client. It includes pages for:Keyword researchLog keyword data like search volume and difficultyCreate topic clusters, and see which ones are most valuable to produceLink optimization reports from Clearscope\/Semrush\/etc. Connect data to the content you’ll be creating to rank for those termsOnce the content is ranking, monitor its rank Content funnelCome up with content ideas of all kinds—from Ultimate Guides to blog posts to podcasts and more—and prioritize them according to keyword data, brand relevance, and preferenceMake sure titles are within 60 characters (or as close as possible) to fit on Google SERPPull keyword data directly into content pages for easy viewing and to stay alignedIdentify Assign writers by sharing each page with them (make sure to also share the full Keyword research page so they can see the data) Set deadlines and move pieces through the funnelLink to published pieces for record-keepingFreelancer managementManage creators across any trade—writing, graphic design, video &amp; moreTrack who’s created which pieces of contentTest out new creators by assigning them a piece of contentGive creators ownership over entire categories In the future…Depending on how well this template does, I’d love to expand it — there’s a lot of room for improvement in terms of managing content distribution, internal linking, backlinking, etc. There’s also a huge opportunity to automate much of the process using Zapier\/Notion API. Donations go to supporting the development of this template! :pray:And, if you’d like to add to the template itself, email me!",
