Though their reputation isn't the best, they are a reference in content marketing here in Brazil.\nMy only experience with their products is Studio. The platform offers nice previews of social media, but it is a bit slow. In addition, I contacted the support, but I had to resolve the issue myself hahah it happened twice. Anyways, I encourage you just to try, but with low expectations",
