I briefly used Contentful, but found the tool too clunky and the rest of the team generally had complaints. We were locked up in a contract and trying to get back to WP as soon as possible. The web developer was also always locked up and complained about how everything took too long. However, Callahan seems to have a more 1-1 experience with Contentful.",
