For deliverability, it just has to be 100%. No debate. For opens, again it has to be 100% but since we can’t achieve this, we rely on follow ups. I get a high of 50% for custom eMails, not blasts. If they don’t open, they don’t get the message, another wasted effort. I find good reply rate 4-6 per every 450 eMails. But I have problems setting up calls and actually closing the leads. Some useful resources include ED Gandia’s eMail guide, free. Also check Dayana Mayfield’s YT interview on cold eMails. This is what worked for me. Another personal insight: don’t send a sequence to someone who didn’t open the first eMail.",
