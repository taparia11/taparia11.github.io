Sometimes I like it better than writing, because I get to wax poetic on the theory and 'why' behind the changes.\n\n&gt; Tell me about the last piece you edited—what was your least favourite part of the process?\nIf anything, the nature of word doc commenting \/ track changes. If there's a lot of changes, things can get messy, and comment space gets outrageously crammed. Though if you know the UI well enough it's navigable. Not sure what I'd do differently.\n\n&gt; Would you ever outsource editorial, or do you see it as a core competency?\nDepends on the gig. If voice\/tone is being tightly managed by myself. I'd want editorial control. Otherwise I'd consider it if volume was starting to become a problem.",
