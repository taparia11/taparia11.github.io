I had two factor authentication set up until I switched to a Republic Wireless phone. Since their numbers are considered VOIP, Twitter wouldn't let me keep that number as a verification tool. So I was without 2-factor awaiting a new phone solution  when someone logged in and changed my email and then my password. \n\nI'm freaking out and have a case opened with Twitter, but without access to the email or phone now associated with it (the hacker changed it), I'm not hopeful they can get it back. I would think with all I did to get the blue checkmark (show my ID and fill out multiple forms) to verify my ID, they would just let anyone else have it. I'm sick over this. Ideas? I have my Twitter feed connected to my Google knowledge panel for my books, so anything tweeted from there shows up on the home page for my name. I think I can disconnect from my knowledge panel in the meantime?",
