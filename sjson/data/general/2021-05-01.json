        "text": "Hi <@U01HEQWRG0G>, such a broad question :slightly_smiling_face: I'll answer from my years of doing email \/ list-building, campaigns in the FMCG segment, with a bulletproof strategy:\n1. Email your existing database - Cash and Credit customers. The tone is saying \"Thank you for your support!\" Give them a % off offer, along with a discount code - redeemable in-store or digital checkout.\n2. This way you can clean, de-dupe, and double opt-in, on that list.\n3. Have created and be ready to deploy this same % discount - as a post - on your brand's FB page.\n4. Once you send the email, post on the clients FB page - \"To qualify for this discount\" - have a link to a FB submission form. \"First name, last name, email, and cell\/mobile\".\n5. Also have created and be ready, to post another FB post - but this time with a giveaway prize AND a sign up \"Click here to enter the competition\" form.\n6. Reply to all first email RESPONDERS - as well as the FB Post sumbitters, with a \"Thank you for your interest\/continued support\" email, and also detail the prize giveaway - having a CTA pointing to the Prize Landing Page, that has a \"First name, last name, email, and cell\/mobile\" form that they need to complete, in order to enter the competition.\n7. Here's the important bit: After they click SUMBIT (or rather \"Click here to Win!\") in the above competition form submission landing page, have them automatically go to a \"Thank You!\" landing page. Keep this page short and sweet, with the ONLY call-to-action being a button to click to go to the clients FaceBook competition page. Say on the email - just above the FB CTA, \"Refer a friend on our FaceBook page by @mentioning, and stand a chance to get even more online &amp; in-store checkout discounts!\"\n8. When you send this 2nd email, post the FB Competition Post.\n9. Every single person that @mentions (refers a friend) on the FB competition post thread, go to that persons FB page and post a thank you -  \"Thank you so much for referring a friend to our competition. Please check your email for your EXTRA shopping discount code!\"\n10. Take these referral names and cross-reference to your first send list. You now have another email list, to send an email - \"Thank You for referring a friend, here is your additional top-up discount code, redeemable in-store or online, at checkout.\"\n11. Here is where the organic part kicks in, and you should now have a tonne of people liking\/sharing\/mentioning(posting) on your clients FB COMPETITION POST. \n12. Now all you have to do is take all these emails coming in from both the FB initial discount code submission forms, and the FB Competition entry page submission form, as well as your clients competition landing page with competition entry submission form, and add them to your new and updated AND GROWING, email list.\n13. PLEASE note that this will only work, if the prize is a decent prize, and will genuinely grab the attention of your existing and new potential clients. Client is going to have to put their money where their mouth is :slightly_smiling_face: \n14. Finally, (having set a date for competition close) randomly draw a person - or a few people -  as prize winners, and announce on clients FB page the results of who the winner(s) is\/are. \n15. Also post on these winners FB pages, and send an email to your entire new list, saying who the winners are (along with a huge thank you).\n16. Note: you will still have a lot of people submitting their info to enter the competition, long after the competition closes. Be ready to send them a \"We are sorry, but the competition has closed. But here is a discount code for showing such amazing support!\" Have a CTA in that email, directing them to the clients website home page.\n17. And there you have it. It's an endeavour of note, but the results can be astounding.\n18. Key points are: Give away something meaningful. Be clear and don't IN ANY WAY come across as scammy. Make the engagement tone personal, warm, and the process easily understood.\n19. You had better have a good system for tracking and collating and managing all this incoming data, so that you don't miss a beat and that no one falls through the cracks. \n20. Client has to have their stuff together, and these discount codes had better damnwell be active and working, in their stores as well as at online checkout, otherwise the negative backlash will be massive, and hugely reputationally damaging.\n21. Based on the success of this campaign - as well at the work involved - decide if client wants to run these campaigns generally as monthly or bi-monthly sends. My experience has shown that this is actually a bad idea, as eventually the clients get tired of the same old thing. That's why it's best to rather re-theme, and run these competitions around specific holidays or special days, such as Mothers Day, Fathers Day, Valentines, etc.\n22. Points to be aware of:\n• Bad copy = Fail. You have to be on point with your creative elements. This includes images.\n• You can swop out the 2nd discount for a buy-one-get-one-free code. Be creative. Anything goes as long as it grabs attention and interest.\n• While I have seen campaigns such as these succeed , I have also seen them bomb out horribly, because of bad creative, incorrect tone, campaign miss-management, and  technical tracking and systems implementation failures.\n:slightly_smiling_face: I know this is a hellofa wall of text, but done right, this process can work incredibly well.",
