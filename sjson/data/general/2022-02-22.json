(I include an \"I'm not sure\" option)\n• Which of these best describes your company\/brand? (eComm, SBB, healthcare provider, influencer, news\/media, or Other)\n• What's your favorite place to buy coffee or tea? (We send a $20 gift card after discovery calls)\n• How did you hear about us? (This usually gives me insight into what kind of company they are and what they know about us)\nI'll provide pricing by service at any time before the discovery call if they ask, but I typically discuss it on the discovery call (typically near the end). Often, clients who ask via email before scheduling a call have a pretty exact budget in mind, so me giving them a price range helps to qualify or disqualify them (on their end). On the discovery call, I'll do a quick calculation of what I recommend and then quote it as a range, but I don't give the exact price until my follow-up email\/proposal so that I make sure I'm only recommending what I think they truly need.\n\nOnce a client has signed a contract with us and paid their first invoice, I send over a more thorough survey to get a brief of everything we need to know about their audience, tone, perspectives, etc. Because we do some pretty particular healthcare topics, I've also had follow-up calls for ~30 minutes with a few clients to have them dictate out their medical perspectives\/research they focus on for those topics.\n\nI hope that helps!!",

        "text": "In my experience, having worked in both capacities:\n• A content strategist is a leading hand strategy role. They create a content plan and coordinate with SEO, web teams, PR, sales, and other relevant teams to create content for different goals. They define which content types to create where and how to best support the customer journey from different perspectives. They define the goals of content and determine KPIs for individual pieces, and those all contribute to the overarching monthly and yearly goals (increase web traffic to x site by xx%, boost sign ups and applications by xx%, increase email list sign ups by xx%, etc). They also determine which actions are most likely to contribute to revenue-generation (like investing in support documentation for sales teams instead of a podcast to raise awareness, because the most pressing business problem is underperforming customer service or onboarding)\n• A content marketer is more of a doer - I think more often than not, a lot of content marketing managers in practice are content marketers and not experienced strategists. They are creating the content or drilling down on what content their team will create to support the overarching strategy, goals, and KPIs. They could own a particular channel or relationship with a team (like a content lead that supports sales enablement, or a content marketer that focuses on a particular social channel. In many cases, content marketing managers have someone above or alongside them defining goals\/don't have express experience demonstrating how content marketing supports revenue growth (IMO -- obviously not the case everywhere, but the bigger the org, the more often I've seen this dynamic).

They define the goals of content and determine KPIs for individual pieces, and those all contribute to the overarching monthly and yearly goals (increase web traffic to x site by xx%, boost sign ups and applications by xx%, increase email list sign ups by xx%, etc). They also determine which actions are most likely to contribute to revenue-generation (like investing in support documentation for sales teams instead of a podcast to raise awareness, because the most pressing business problem is underperforming customer service or onboarding)"

They could own a particular channel or relationship with a team (like a content lead that supports sales enablement, or a content marketer that focuses on a particular social channel.
