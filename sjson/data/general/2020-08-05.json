This, I belive was foundational to the success as I helped see them through to their first 2,000 customers before we brought on our head of marketing.\n\nAs time went on, I kept a pulse on the growing customer base by working with our success managers and releasing a case study every week, and those case study interviews constantly fed back into the rest of the content strategy.\n\nAt QuickBooks, I had a _very_ different challenge.

That took a lot of trust, so I was sharing what I learned as I went along, and eventually, I put together a deck that  laid  out where we were going.\n\nI also made it _*very clear from the outset*_ that I am a chef, not a short order cook, and I needed time to gather my ingredients and put the recipes together. Part of that recipe was what I called  \"mapping the internal networks\"  so I could get an understanding of all of the players involved and what their expectations were. I wanted to let people know this was a collaborative effort, but also to let me do what I'm best at.\n\nFortunately, doing that up front set really solid expectations, and I ended up having more authority to do what I deemed necessary and didn't have to ask for  a lot of permission after that.",

CXL wasn't nearly the brand name it is today when I started, so we were experimenting with formats and trying new things all the time. It was actually content development. Same deal at Shopify Plus, and then at QuickBooks.\n\nThe major thing I've noticed, honestly, is that the bigger the company gets, the more specialized they want you to become.\n\nTo me, EIC has always meant putting out good content regardless of format on the primary publishing hub. The larger the organization gets though, the more of a lane people want you to be in because they have someone else who does that other thing. This is a double edged sword.\n\nAt QuickBooks, when I became Global Editor-in-Chief, what that became wasn't about experimenting with multiple formats, or even getting too close to the content itself,  but rather setting the tone and  scaling the operation to a global scale.\n\nBy the time I was done there, I had learned how to scale the operation from one market to 16, and break down the organizational barriers that existed between SEO, Blog, Design, Social and Email, to make sure we had a consistent voice across all channels and having maximum distribution opportunities.\n\nThat was WAY more behind the scenes work, but it had a MASSIVE impact overall org.\n\nIn my mind, EIC encoupasses all of these things.",

It's changed from position to position for sure.\n\nSomething I've realized now that I'm back on the market is that \"Editor in Chief\" is actually pretty limiting. CXL wasn't nearly the brand name it is today when I started, so we were experimenting with formats and trying new things all the time. It was actually content development. Same deal at Shopify Plus, and then at QuickBooks.\n\nThe major thing I've noticed, honestly, is that the bigger the company gets, the more specialized they want you to become.\n\nTo me, EIC has always meant putting out good content regardless of format on the primary publishing hub. The larger the organization gets though, the more of a lane people want you to be in because they have someone else who does that other thing.

What products are you trying to sell and how can we bridge the gap from where people  are to where they want to go. If I start with the product page (or more accurately, work with the copywriter who does) what's the story that drives people to that page?\n\nAs a tangent, I started as a career actor, and one of the things we focused on was narrative structure of serialized TV dramas. If I treat email sequences with that same \"programming\" in mind, I know where the story is going to end up, so how can I work backwards from that?\n\nThe question then becomes, who is going to buy into this story and who needs it? From a B2B perspective, is it the Sr marketer who's making the case to their group marketing manager, is it the CEO? How tech forward are they? You could ask a million different questions from there.\n\nI've done this with an existing customer base and without.\n\nWith the customer base, it simply starts with the customer and interviewing (which, I also turned into case studies later on) and finding patterns.\n\nWithout the customer base, it's a lot of audience development and account based marketing tactics (I'm in this place now with my own business.) When you're in this position, you're in a place where you can start to develop your personas on your own (research backed of course) and update your assumptions as you go along and get real people. Sometimes you're spot on, sometimes you're way off base, but ultimately, it's a continual refinement and something that should be revisited as the customer base expands anyhow.",

What products are you trying to sell and how can we bridge the gap from where people  are to where they want to go. If I start with the product page (or more accurately, work with the copywriter who does) what's the story that drives people to that page?\n\nAs a tangent, I started as a career actor, and one of the things we focused on was narrative structure of serialized TV dramas. If I treat email sequences with that same \"programming\" in mind, I know where the story is going to end up, so how can I work backwards from that?\n\nThe question then becomes, who is going to buy into this story and who needs it? From a B2B perspective, is it the Sr marketer who's making the case to their group marketing manager, is it the CEO? How tech forward are they? You could ask a million different questions from there.\n\nI've done this with an existing customer base and without.\n\nWith the customer base, it simply starts with the customer and interviewing (which, I also turned into case studies later on) and finding patterns.\n\nWithout the customer base, it's a lot of audience development and account based marketing tactics (I'm in this place now with my own business.) When you're in this position, you're in a place where you can start to develop your personas on your own (research backed of course) and update your assumptions as you go along and get real people. Sometimes you're spot on, sometimes you're way off base, but ultimately, it's a continual refinement and something that should be revisited as the customer base expands anyhow."
