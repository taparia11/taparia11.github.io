I have a client that solicited me for an about me page and then is wanting to book me for that as additional work. Has anyone done press releases before or a press kit. I would like to tackle this to gain the experience but I am curious if anyone else has any experience with this to guide me further on the PR side of this. Thanks in advance for the advice, comments, and info!",
