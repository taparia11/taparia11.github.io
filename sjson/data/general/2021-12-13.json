Please note that most of what I'm saying is more of a concern when you have two domains both focused on _English speaking_ markets. Things are a bit different with ccTLD’s focused on localizing content for different languages.\n\nIf you have multiple domains live, they are viewed separately by Google. Launching a new domain to focus on the US market isn't a bad idea, but it should be viewed as an entirely new website, not just a duplicate version of what you already have. If you do duplicate your site, you may run into duplicative issues and hinder your main site.\n\nSo before asking yourself the questions about the technical areas, make sure you can also answer the following:\nDo you have the resources to write unique content for another country?\nDo you have the budget to maintain two sites? Both from a hosting POV and web dev POV? \nCan you dedicate a great amount of time to building authority?\nCan you do all of this while the .com domain makes no money? \n\nI've answered your q’s below too, but please let me know if you have more questions!\n\n1. There are many, many implications (both good and bad) but I would need more context in order to nail down specifics. Some examples include: doubling the cost, doubling maintenance, potential cannibalism issues, duplicate content issues (if you're really just copying and pasting the content over and not making it unique), lack of authority for the other TLD, etc\n2. It is not that easy.\n3. Yes the transition will likely negatively impact your SEO IF you are removing a domain. If you are completely removing the UK domain you may substantially lose traffic for a bit of time. If you are just rebuilding the content from scratch on another domain, you won't hopefully have negative impacts on the UK domain, but it depends on if you execute correctly.
