FWIW, looking at the blog post you cited, I'd say the main thing to establish before trying to figure out how best to source this sort of content is \"to what degree do you intend to produce content that requires engineering knowledge of Notion?\"\nIf the answer is \"a lot,,\" then I'd suggest what you're really looking for is a DevRel because trying to source it internally will result in a lot of \"let our engineers write code,\" trying to source it with tech writer will be a slog, and trying to source it with freelance engineers will result in a lot of ghosting as they figure out the learning curve for Notion's inner workings increases the pay they'd want by an order of magnitude.  But a DevRel (contractor or FTE) will specifically understand the pattern of \"learn the offering, communicate it to the community.\"\n\nIf that post isn't representative, and you're looking for general tutorial posts to attract engineers as a segment, outsourcing content to a business like mine, or <http:\/\/fixate.io|fixate.io> or what have you _can_ be a good play.  But, if you have a decent amount of staff dedicated to the editorial process, you're probably best served to source it to freelancer software engineers doing it as a side hustle.  If that's the case, I'm happy to share thoughts on where\/how to find them, including an email list with about 1,000 of them on it that we curate for side hustle opportunities.\n\nAnyway, happy to talk shop or offer further thoughts if you want to shoot me a DM.  I know that sourcing that style of content can feel like a serious quagmire.  (And, no worries on me gearing up for a sales pitch -- we're not taking on much new business at the moment)",
