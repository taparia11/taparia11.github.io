How Topic help us, is building effective outlines which we delegate to writers who knows how to write and have domain-expertise for that particular industry niche.\n\nThe speed of creating outlines is a good value prop BUT the main benefit for me was making sure to have my data points of research, chapters, ALONG with information from asking our customers in one great article.\n\nEven for content marketing work, SEO optimization is just one piece of the puzzle, serving the right customer to the target audience is still priority one. Only after this priority is solved I’d go and see how much SEO optimization layer of paint I can attach to satisfy search crawlers.",

How Topic help us, is building effective outlines which we delegate to writers who knows how to write and have domain-expertise for that particular industry niche.\n\nThe speed of creating outlines is a good value prop BUT the main benefit for me was making sure to have my data points of research, chapters, ALONG with information from asking our customers in one great article.\n\nEven for content marketing work, SEO optimization is just one piece of the puzzle, serving the right customer to the target audience is still priority one. Only after this priority is solved I’d go and see how much SEO optimization layer of paint I can attach to satisfy search crawlers."
