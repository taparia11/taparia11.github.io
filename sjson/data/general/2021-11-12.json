We believe that the future belongs to creators (you'll see that tagline all over the place for us).\n\nWhen it comes to content strategy, we believe that the more we put our creators as the focus of our pieces the easier it will be for other creators who are in similar fields to connect and understand how they can use our tools and features in their own business.\n\nAs far as tips go- We are currently trying to create more case studies that connect to our bigger Creator Story features. That way readers can get that fuzzy inspirational vibe and then get a solid deep dive into a specific strategy that the creator uses.\n\nFor example:\n<https:\/\/convertkit.com\/creator-stories-khe-hy>\n<https:\/\/convertkit.com\/khe-hy-case-study>",

This means focusing on providing tips on your niche, advice, giving valuable freebies (guides, video trainings, checklists), letting them know more about you and your story, and opening up the digital door for them to build a relationship with you (hopping on a 1 on 1 call to discuss their needs, Q&amp;A's, AMA's, etc). This by far is the best thing you can do when starting out in order to build up enough trust with your small list so they can become your customers, give you positive testimonials, and refer you to others!",

This means focusing on providing tips on your niche, advice, giving valuable freebies (guides, video trainings, checklists), letting them know more about you and your story, and opening up the digital door for them to build a relationship with you (hopping on a 1 on 1 call to discuss their needs, Q&A's, AMA's, etc). This by far is the best thing you can do when starting out in order to build up enough trust with your small list so they can become your customers, give you positive testimonials, and refer you to others!"

It maybe be my oldest-child mentality, but I've LOVED figuring out how to organize and repurpose our content. And to be honest, I'm just now really figuring out what our content flywheel is and how we can operate more with cross-team collaborations.\n\nI think the most difficult part is the blue sky of it all. One piece of content can do so much and just figuring out all the different ways we can use it right now is the overwhelming piece- how-to videos, onboarding videos, knowledge base pieces, funnels, testimonials, etc.\n\nMy biggest tip right now is probably what I'm in the process of doing myself- Figure out that flywheel. How does your content fit in the bigger picture of your overall strategy? What types of content needs are you looking to fill? Basically, how can your content create more content?",

And to be honest, I'm just now really figuring out what our content flywheel is and how we can operate more with cross-team collaborations.\n\nI think the most difficult part is the blue sky of it all. One piece of content can do so much and just figuring out all the different ways we can use it right now is the overwhelming piece- how-to videos, onboarding videos, knowledge base pieces, funnels, testimonials, etc.\n\nMy biggest tip right now is probably what I'm in the process of doing myself- Figure out that flywheel. How does your content fit in the bigger picture of your overall strategy? What types of content needs are you looking to fill? Basically, how can your content create more content?"

This helps us create the right nurture sequences, activation sequences, and send the right kind of content promo to the right group of people (like specific webinar topics) in an organized fashion so that it's not such a tangled web.\n\nTo help us not go overboard with this, it was important for us (as a company) to fine tune who our target audience was FIRST. Getting specific with those details including:\n• What are our main goals? \n• What milestones are we were looking for our customers to achieve with our product? \n• What industries would we like to generate a presence in? \nBased off the above, we can format specific sequences that focus on the goals that the team is all aligned with, rather than trying to _be \"everything for everyone\"._ \n\nI hope this helps!",

What's the strategy behind producing those, and is it different from your case studies?",

I need to be better about setting up a system to help our featured creators share their stories as well. I think they are closed to the bottom of the funnel. A creator is looking for an email marketing tool, they've found us and are seeing specific ways they can use us to connect with their audience\/grow their business. \n2. Can't pull any numbers now, but we look at accounts attributed to the pieces and traffic.\n3. Creator Stories actually came first! These are purely brand awareness and are handled by the brand team. Those stories don't necessarily have to mention email marketing or our tool unless they come up naturally. They are purely created to make our creators the hero. And then the ball is passed to me ( on the Marketing team) to take that inspirational story, figure out if there is an interesting angle to how they use our tool and create a quick guide to show how other creators can find simliar success.",
