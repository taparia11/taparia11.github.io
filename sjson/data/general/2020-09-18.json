I’ve been at Sprout for just over five years, and though I lead our content team today, I’ve held a number of roles in the past ranging from communications generalist, to PR, to internal communications. Sprout has grown a ton since I started and it’s been a really interesting ride, so I’m excited to talk to you all about everything content; diversity, equity and inclusion; employer brand and marketing.

I’ve been at Sprout for just over five years, and though I lead our content team today, I’ve held a number of roles in the past ranging from communications generalist, to PR, to internal communications. Sprout has grown a ton since I started and it’s been a really interesting ride, so I’m excited to talk to you all about everything content; diversity, equity and inclusion; employer brand and marketing. Let’s dive in!"

I have a lot to say about this one… :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nOne of our core values at Sprout is to champion diversity, equity and inclusion, and that is woven into our culture, hiring and operations. It’s something our whole marketing team considers when sourcing event speakers, researching interviewees for thought leadership pieces, finding social and brand examples for our posts, selecting vendors, etc. For some content inspiration, I wanted to share <https:\/\/media.sproutsocial.com\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Storytelling-questions-for-DEI.png|these great questions> that <https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/kerripang\/detail\/background-image\/|Kerri Pang>, the Lead Video Producer at Sprout, recently shared during a presentation on customer storytelling.\n\nWe need to proactively seek out and prioritize diversity in marketing—especially in tech. When we don’t, it’s easy to fall prey to good intentions with nothing to show for them. One thing we do is try to bring different perspectives and underrepresented voices into our brainstorms and content planning. We’ve worked with employees from different departments as well as people who are part of our Business Resource Groups (e.g. Black at Sprout, Women@Sprout, etc.) to co-create content that supports our marketing efforts, and to help facilitate their goals as well. This is beneficial in multiple ways!\n\nI also think it’s really important to report back on performance, just like you would any other marketing effort. I share the results of our efforts with my stakeholders on marketing but also with any of the other groups like network partners, the People Team or BRG leaders that work with us. Knowing something is the right thing to do is a good start, but when you align your investment in promoting diversity, equity and inclusion with the success of your marketing efforts...fireworks.\n\nIn terms of the marketing team, recruiting and retention are major pieces of DEI, including sourcing, mentorship and career investment. One example mentioned in our 2020 DEI Report is a sourcing pilot program we’re doing to expand and diversify our networks, focusing on BIPOC marketers. As part of this program, I’ve identified 10 people I’d like to connect with and started setting up conversations with people with skills we might be looking for in the future. These conversations have been a lot of fun and surfaced some great, mutually beneficial opportunities! This is a great place to partner with your recruiting or people team, but you can also start your own solo “pilot program” to build and diversify your network, share opportunities and set yourself up for hiring success in the future.",

There are a lot of good questions to unpack here.\n\n1. *Content and PR balance:* I’m not personally leading our PR efforts anymore, but I got into content via PR—when I was focused there, I would create a quarterly data report as thought leadership content to pitch, and I would write or edit media bylines as needed. When we went through a restructure in 2018, I moved into a content (and internal comms) role. Having that PR background helps me identify and advocate for ideas that will support both content + PR goals. From there, I err on the side of overcommunication and so does our PR lead, and that presents a lot of opportunities to maximize our resources. A lot of our content can serve two or more goals, so we try to ensure we have a healthy mix of content to support the awareness efforts of PR and social as well as our content marketing and acquisition goals.\n2. *Ideal team makeup:* I love our makeup now, which is two separate but closely-collaborating teams under the overall “Buzz Team” (content, comms, PR, social, events)! If I were on a smaller team, it would depend on overall marketing goals and where the company was in terms of market share and brand awareness. I’d want to handle content in-house and have a second person in a more cross-functional comms role (PR, internal, speaking, etc), likely managing an external PR agency. This gives content the ability to build close ties with demand gen, sales, success and other internal teams with no gatekeepers; whereas a PR has a major external influence—media—and is often focused on telling your brand’s high level stories. Owning media relationships and keeping a pulse on that giant ecosystem is something a strong agency can do for you if you want your internal team to focus on PR strategy, working with exec stakeholders, etc. But, that team structure is also based on my strengths\/interests so it might be the opposite for others!\n3. *Making the case for non-SEO content:* I’m lucky here, for two reasons: 1, I sit on the “Buzz” team which is primarily focused on brand awareness and perception; 2, as a social media software company, we place a huge value on our social presence. So the metrics we look at aren’t solely acquisition-focused but also measured by things like supporting PR (media placements, target placements, impressions) and our social efforts (impressions, engagements, and so forth). \nEvery piece of content has a specific goal and different dimensions of performance based on that—for example, I’m not expecting a 500-word op-ed to be an SEO slam dunk, but I am expecting it to drive social engagements and impressions because it gets people talking and sharing. I think it’s a combo of educating your stakeholders on different opportunities that content can contribute to, and constantly reporting back your results and learnings. Even positioning something as an experiment or a short-term test with an end date can help ease exec discomfort if you’re branching outside of business as usual.",

We work with our social and community teams to use features like Twitter and Instagram Polls to weigh in or get data points for content, to pose questions to our community and to source SMEs for quotes.\n6. *My network, specifically <https:\/\/twitter.com\/aliciabjohnston\/|Twitter>:* I follow a ton of social media experts and try to intentionally cultivate relationships with a diverse group of marketers.

I have been lucky to have a manager who is a great mentor and a very thoughtful leader--I’d be remiss not to mention that she is a key factor in my growth over the years. :heart:\n\nI started as a communications generalist; I had a couple years of nonprofit and freelance\/blogging experience but it was an entry-level role doing some PR support, supporting speaking, award submissions, employer brand…and Sprout was small so I also helped the social team and wrote SEO blog posts. Really anything that came my way.\n\nFrom there I moved into a role leading our PR and managing our agency. Then, Sprout kept growing and I added internal communications (so kind of a corp comms role). We hired someone else to take over PR, and I moved to internal comms and specifically thought leadership content. Then we hired an IC lead right before our IPO (thank goodness) and I moved to focus solely on content.\n\nMy main pivotal points\/tips would be:\n• Stay open to opportunities. I originally thought I wanted to stay in corporate comms and it was my boss who asked me to shift focus entirely to content. She saw something I didn’t, and she was right.\n• Ask a ton of questions. There is no stupid question. I am constantly asking people on other teams how they pulled a certain report, how they made a decision, etc. These can help you grow, and help you improve your own reporting on performance in order to make a case for growth\/new positions.\n• Talk to other people in the industry.  Truly, this group has been incredible this year. I have met so many smart people and I love reading perspective from this group. Thank you, <@UJG9WTEKG>!\nI feel like I should say more about the self-advocacy piece but I’m seeing a ton of q’s come in, so let me save this one and come back to you more later!",

Really anything that came my way.\n\nFrom there I moved into a role leading our PR and managing our agency. Then, Sprout kept growing and I added internal communications (so kind of a corp comms role). We hired someone else to take over PR, and I moved to internal comms and specifically thought leadership content. Then we hired an IC lead right before our IPO (thank goodness) and I moved to focus solely on content.\n\nMy main pivotal points\/tips would be:\n"

That includes some placeholders for timely content, supporting new projects that arise, etc. We try to fill the calendar to about 80% of what we expect our capacity to be in order to flex. We moved to a much higher volume of publishing this year and candidly, this has been an adjustment and constantly learning for me! I’m used to shooting for the max, e.g. if our strategy calls for 15-20 pieces, I want to plan 20 and we’ll add on top of that. I’ve had to adjust my mentality to ensure that my team collectively has the time and creative wherewithal to not just meet what’s on the calendar but to riff, adapt and follow great ideas where they lead."

I also have a workflow in Slack that sends a “content ideas form” to sales and success once a month.\nThere are a lot of other smaller touchpoints but I also can’t take credit for everything here--our demand gen team and sales enablement team handle a ton of things like regularly producing Content Digests for sales that include content, Outreach email templates and links to Showpad, our sales content platform.
