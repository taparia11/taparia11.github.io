Fast forward nearly 10 years and I think content marketing has a much clearer set of specialties and focus areas that have emerged - primarily around audience or the end goals for the program.\n\nSo the biggest change in running an agency, and one thing I wish I had done sooner, is that specializing within content marketing is critical. This has been true for agencies forever, but people were much more interested in a 'content marketing agency' in 2012, and now are much more interested in a 'content marketing agency that specializes in dev ops thought leadership'.",

Fast forward nearly 10 years and I think content marketing has a much clearer set of specialties and focus areas that have emerged - primarily around audience or the end goals for the program.\n\nSo the biggest change in running an agency, and one thing I wish I had done sooner, is that specializing within content marketing is critical. This has been true for agencies forever, but people were much more interested in a 'content marketing agency' in 2012, and now are much more interested in a 'content marketing agency that specializes in dev ops thought leadership'."

With that in mind, we're very focused on solving a workflow problem to help you build those insights, as opposed to generating recommendations that we think your team needs to follow.\n\nWith that said, the workflow won't work if the data is garbage, so we're fairly picky about data sources, what we show users, how we process the data, etc.\n\nIn regards to the literal topic model, we analyze the top 30-40 competitors in the SERP for your target keyword (we actually combine results from a couple of SERP variations so the number of results varies). Once we have that list, we process them through IBM's NLP API, do a bunch of post-processing and de-duplication, and then we prioritize our topic model based upon the number of competitors using each set of terms.\n\nFrom the competitors you listed, that process is closest to Clearscope, since Frase &amp; MarketMuse use their own internal topic\/keyword models and extraction process.\n\nI think our content grader stands up well against comparisons to those and other competitors, but there are lots of mini features and product decisions that will appeal to different teams that each competitor has, so while 'grading' has become commoditized IMO, there's still plenty of ways to stand out.\n\nWe're not looking at tackling long-form NLG problems right now - eg we don't want to generate your article or copy for you.
