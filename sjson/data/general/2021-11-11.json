Crawl budget doesn’t influence traffic.\n\nLastly, traffic\/backlinks shouldn’t be the basis for pruning content. The main issue revolves around quality of content. Don’t be the one that uses a butcher’s blade when a scalpel is what’s required.\n\nLook to improve the content as opposed to giving it the axe.",

It can still accumulate and pass PageRank, so I assume it can still influence other determinations made by Google’s systems.\n\nCrawl budget isn’t an issue until you get into the millions of pages (if they update moderately - like once a week) or tens of thousands (if they update frequently - like daily).\n\nAlso, the assertion that removing pages boosts traffic since crawl budget goes to high traffic pages is incorrect. Crawl budget doesn’t influence traffic.\n\nLastly, traffic\/backlinks shouldn’t be the basis for pruning content. The main issue revolves around quality of content. Don’t be the one that uses a butcher’s blade when a scalpel is what’s required.\n\nLook to improve the content as opposed to giving it the axe."
