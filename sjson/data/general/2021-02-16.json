Typically the product marketing manager is not leading these activities or even having a strong voice\nA few tips from my experience:\n• Make sure both the product marketing manager and content marketing manager know what they are responsible for leading vs. what they will provide feedback or input on\n• Make sure other stakeholders are aware of the differences in functions\n• Always collaborate - the content larger strategy needs to include both elements ",
