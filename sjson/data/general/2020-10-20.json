One-off commissions would be more manageable.\n\nIf you were to do more hands on work like \"editing\" and value adds, then you could have the \"pass through\" revenue, but you would also be managing work.\n\nOff the top of my head, the best example of a model you could emulate is staffing agencies such as Creative Circle.",
