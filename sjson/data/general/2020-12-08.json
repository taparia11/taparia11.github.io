You can go to <http:\/\/healthcare.gov|healthcare.gov> or <http:\/\/healthsherpa.com|healthsherpa.com> (my company, it’s a partner to <http:\/\/healthcare.gov|healthcare.gov>) to get covered. Make sure to enroll by the December 15 deadline! And if you Google health insurance, definitely don’t click the ads - those typically take you to lead generation websites that will try to sell you plans that don’t comply with the Affordable Care Act. It’s better to go through one of the sites I linked because they only show ACA plans.",
