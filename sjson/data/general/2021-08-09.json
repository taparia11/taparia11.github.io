I’d love to get to know more content marketers (since I’m the only one in my team) and being active in this community seems like a great way to do that. But I’m finding it really difficult to find the time and headspace to regularly read up on what’s been posted and participate in discussions. So I’m curious how those of you that are contributing great stuff on the reg fit that into your work day? Do you allocate time for it specifically or is it something that happens organically for you?",
