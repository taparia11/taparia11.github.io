Also a bigger screen, so I’m not constantly leaning toward it. Finally, I try to get up about every 20 mins to grab water, coffee, hit the bathroom — just so I’m not sedentary too long and get my blood flowing! I also try to take 2 walks every day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Neither need to be super long but at least like 15-20 around my neighborhood really helps the aches and tension. I also see a chiropractor and massage therapist regularly. After 8 years of being a “keyboard athlete,” I have realized that it’s worth investing in to keep myself in good shape to continue my “athletic activities!”",
