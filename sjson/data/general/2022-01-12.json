        "text": "Hey everyone! I have signed countless contracts with agencies as a freelancer over the years, but one I'm looking at now has me a little stumped. 1) Do you currently include \"prospective clients\" in your non-solicitation clauses, and if so, how do you define this? Customers you've submitted a proposal to, etc? I would like a potential agency client to include a definition before I sign, so that I'm not locking myself out of work with anyone they've sent a direct mailer to, for example. 2) The contract states I will pay a percentage of earnings to this agency for any services performed in violation of this 18-month non-solicitation clause. I've seen this before, and it was never a problem, but this clause specifically states that the percentage is of _*the gross fees and other compensation received by me and any person or firm with which I am affiliated in connection with such client.*_  If I'm reading this right, not only would I have to pay a percentage of what *I make* as a freelancer if I violate this clause, but the percentage would be of the total project cost made by the agency that hires me. So I could be on the hook for x% of a $100,000 project, even if I only do a $400 blog post for them. Has anyone seen anything like this? If you own an agency, what wording would you recommend. Thanks.",
