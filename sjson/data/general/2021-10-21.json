I worked as a full-time copywriter for an in-house content team at a health website, and most of the writers produced 4-5 quality pieces each week at a similar word count expectation. Two of my in-house agency folks have also kept up a similar pace.\n\nPersonally, as a writer, I couldn't keep that pace. I had to move into an editorial role because I wasn't built for keeping up with the writing.\n\nI don't think the management hierarchy is bad. My guess is the lead copywriter has been expected to help train writers."
