If you've rebuilt it in the last month and I'm looking at the finished product, Kudos! :raised_hands:\n\n1. You can filter bots from GA to view more accurate data, however it does look like you don't have any organic traffic according to Ahrefs - <https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/1010249?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6014102|View Settings>.\n2. Your backlinks are on the uptrend! it makes sense to try to preserve them. If you start a new site, it isn't impossible to 301 redirect your backlinks, but can be a bit of a hassle.\n3. Your robots.txt is not disallowing bots. I'd update it to disallow all, but allow google and Ahrefs, and any others you need. \nAfter <https:\/\/www.hostinger.com\/tutorials\/wordpress-robots-txt|updating your robots.txt in WordPress>, you should see GA traffic --&gt; 0 immediately, even without editing your view settings to filter. _If you're on UA, you should have a Master, Raw, and Test view (master = filtered, raw= no filters). If you're on GA4 only, you'll need to apply the bot filtering property-wide._\n\nLooking at your content, you are missing meta descriptions on some blog posts (according to Ahrefs), and your target kws are way too TOFU imo. For your backlink profile and knowledge domain, you'll need to target Ahrefs KD&lt;10 to start out. Content length is good :raised_hands: , and the stats are great link magnets- probably explains the jump up in backlinks you've got so far.\n\nAs for building a lead gen site, I see no reason to jump ship from WP. Although there are alternatives out there, (Ghost, Webflow) I see no major problems with your setup from a SEO perspective.",
