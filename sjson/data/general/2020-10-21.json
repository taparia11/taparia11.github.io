There are some big name people that I could potentially interview and develop content on, but I would need brands\/clients lined up beforehand and have a pitch\/concept all squared away. I've been cold-emailing companies within tech over the past week or two, but no response really. Any advice or thoughts on trying to line up more content for this and make the most of it?
