When I was a partner at my last agency (retired from that) we had liability insurance because our major corporate clients (Ontario govt, Hydro One, etc) demanded it. We were required to get $5MM coverage. It cost a few thousand a year. Cost of business - no choice. I forget where we got it, only that it wasn’t easy to find someone. I think our general insurance broker got us the contact. In your case, I wouldn’t bother. Previous to that, working freelance for many years, I didn’t have it and no one asked. ",
