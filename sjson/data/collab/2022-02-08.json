Otherwise they'll face questions like, \"Why aren't you remote?\" Without an answer that puts employee wellbeing at its heart, I think they'll have a hard time.\n\nWhy work remote (locally) vs remote (at a distance)? My answer would be culture. I would personally prefer a smaller, less-paid position if it had great company culture. I'd better wake up and look forward to work, or I'll start looking elsewhere."
