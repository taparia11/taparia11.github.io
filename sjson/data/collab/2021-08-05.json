        "text": "\n• How do you allocate resources for a project?\n&gt; We use Scoro for this. When generating quotes you can assign resources beforehand and then change them as needed using a _Planner view._ It enables us to filter by team and task type to view how everyone's capacity looks. If work is outsourced or involves purchases, it can account for that as well when generating quotes or planning projects. \n\n• What are the benefits of resource allocation?\n&gt; For us the main ones are ensuring people don't get overworked and that projects remain on time and under budget.\n\n• Which tools do you use to manage resources (if any)?\n&gt; Scoro handles everything for us.\n\n• How do you handle changes in resource availability? E.g. project scope changes, unexpected delays, etc.\n&gt; With scope changes requested by the client, we simply issue a new quote for the additional requests and extend out the deadline as needed. \n&gt; \n&gt; If it's a scope change on our end that we didn't foresee, then we discuss it with our clients and sometimes absorb it as an expense not billable to the client. Importantly, when this happens we discuss this during our sprint retrospectives to help prevent it from happening again. \n&gt; \n&gt; As for delays, we run a sprint-based model to some extent; so if there are delays we can usually pivot resources fairly quickly by swapping items in and out from the backlog.\n\n• What does your capacity planning process look like?\n&gt; Since we operate in sprints, we're able to get a decent sense on what our burn down rate looks like across the whole team and down at the individual level. \n&gt; \n&gt; This makes estimating what resources will be needed much simpler. \n&gt; Scoro has utilization reports that look forward several weeks in advance. \n&gt; \n&gt; It makes it much easier to see current and future capacity, as well as where future constraints will exist that we'll need to plan for by either shifting workload around, subcontracting, or hiring new employees for.\n\n• Any tips\/best practices?\n&gt; *#1 Productize Things*\n&gt; If you're a service-based business, productize your offering as much as possible. Dev resources into automating what makes sense to automate are _money well spent_ here. \n&gt; \n&gt; *#2 Time Estimates are Unreliable*\n&gt; Don’t use hours by themselves to estimate capacity. It takes different people different amounts of time to do things and it will vary from project to project. Sprint points are handy here in that they're relative and give you a more realistic picture of how much capacity someone can handle that's reflexive over time.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Value-Based &gt; Time-Based*\n&gt; If you're a service-based business, don't sell time for money. Value-based pricing is not only more profitable but it's easier to manage resources internally for.",
