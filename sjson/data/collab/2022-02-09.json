Well, I think the main things that stuck out to me that made my recent onboarding such a good experience are as follows:\n-Plenty of communication before my first day. My position is 100% remote, so it's not like I could just show up on my first day and everything would be ready for me. I received plenty of communication from the HR department and the IT department leading up to my first day so that I would be ready to go. I picked up my IT equipment a few days before I started and it was all ready to plug and play. I knew what my calendar would look like over the first few days so I wouldn't be surprised by meetings. I felt very prepared going into my first day.\n-Thorough orientation. My first 1-2 weeks were filled with meetings with all the different departments and team members that were all scheduled for me by HR. I was able to get face time with all the key people in the company and start learning about the business right away. I also received a document filled with information about the company, my teammates, our competitors, good newsletters to subscribe to, industry resources, and more. I still reference this document because it's so helpful.\n-An onboarding buddy. Every new hire at my company is paired with an onboarding buddy. Your buddy is someone who checks in on you and can answer questions. They're someone from outside your immediate team so that you can start to make friends in other departments. My onboarding buddy and I have become good friends. It's nice to have someone to go to who isn't HR or your boss when you have questions or want a second opinion.\n\nHope that helps!",
