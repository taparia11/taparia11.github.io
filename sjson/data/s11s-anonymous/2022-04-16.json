If lack of right training\/guidance is the core issue, the employee should've proactively taken steps to address that\n3. Are there other people in her team as well? Are they performing well? If so, then it's a slack from Her end.\n4. I'm sure her roles and responsibilities are outlined and she knows exactly what she's supposed to do. If that is so, then a manager not performing for personal reasons should not be a scape-goat for her performance.\n5. I would be empathetic, give her a fair fighting chance, but also address these core issues.\nSolution:\nReview her performance and give her an appraisal that is lesser than everybody else. Tell her that this is an opportunity\/warning for you to grow and get better at your responsibilities. Give her a 3-month window to show elevated results or there is an imminent PIP at the end of 3 months. Tell her that we are looking at fixing the management issues but she needs to start behaving as an individual contributor and not be dependent\/hand-held by her manager (considering she's been in the system for a while now)\n\nIf anybody else has any other thoughts, happy to be corrected :slightly_smiling_face:",
