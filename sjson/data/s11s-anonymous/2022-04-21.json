Currently in one of the larger B2B SaaS companies in India and getting paid decently well. However, I'm facing burnout and lack of enthusiasm at work for a while, so want to chill out for a month and get my mojo back before diving into the next stage of my career. I have 2 questions\n\n1. How difficult do you think it will be to find an equivalent role given this break?\n2. Should I expect a drop in my negotiating power since I won't have the luxury of staying at my current role?",

Currently in one of the larger B2B SaaS companies in India and getting paid decently well. However, I'm facing burnout and lack of enthusiasm at work for a while, so want to chill out for a month and get my mojo back before diving into the next stage of my career. I have 2 questions\n\n1. How difficult do you think it will be to find an equivalent role given this break?\n2. Should I expect a drop in my negotiating power since I won't have the luxury of staying at my current role?"

        "text": "Once you start seeing it, the caste divide becomes very evident. I've seen it in all orgs. I've worked at. There are two problems:\n1. Orgs. don't take special interest in inclusivity. They are not incentivized to because their success depends on human resource merit.\n2. There aren't many applicants from non-upper castes because the divide starts at birth, not at graduation or employment. (heck, not even birth of the candidate, but the candidate's ancestors). The low representation at applicant level reflects in employee percentages. Naturally, this further dwindles with seniority. \nOrganizations will have to take a conscious step to hiring the best non-upper caste folks. These best folks will provide the stepping stone for the next generation. But they are not obligated (except 0.1% revenue contribution towards CSR).\nAnother possible solution is if upper-caste folks mentor or guide non-upper caste professionals so the entire disregarded community benefits and trickles down through generations. The community doesn't have as many successful folks who can work as mentors or even people to look up to. Yes, there are outliers.\n\nThe solution is not as simple as \"lack of inclusivity\" which is an easy observation.",

If you're coming from a position of belief, without a backing logic, then it would be hard to reason through.\n\nAnswer two questions for me:\n\n1. What do you think 'diversity' means?\n2. As a business, you have a choice to hire from two candidates. One is clearly better than the other for the proposed job. Would you rather hire the lesser qualified person to balance your diversity equation? What is the business case for it? When would you stop and go the other way (i.e. merit) if at all?\n\nSorry missed answering your question:\n\n```but do you think social circumstance\/stigma or context of place of living\/upbringing and opprotunities etc has any impact on someone's merit? If it doesn't, I would respectfully disengage from conversation with you right there as I think we are in different ends of the world in this aspect.```\nOfcourse it does, but I do not think forcing yourself to hire to balance that equation is the right way to go. There are different ways to solve different problems.\n\nEither you become a social crusader and balance every possible diversity equation there is, (let's also balance basis blood types, sounds ridiculous is it? But pretty soon there would come up a group which will say they're not equally represented)\n\nor\n\nYou keep merit as your guiding light. Focus on finding the best people who can serve your customers the best regardless of their background. Sure if there is an equal merit candidate which helps me balance my diversity equation, I would go out of my way to hire them (business case: diversity brings different perspectives which may help).\n\nThe way to solve it lies in the hands of the people who feel discriminated. Regardless of who we are, we have one universal right and that is the right to vote. Vote to bring leaders who can uplift you. Sadly most people shortchange their votes for short term gains or vote basis religion and this problem doesn't change.\n\nThese are systemic problems where capitalism is not the best model to solve them. They need to be solved using public policy. That debate is entirely different. Till that point comes, you can hope to have the hiring diversity equal to the candidate pool diversity. The candidate pool diversity needs to be addressed with public policy. Don't mix the two.\n\nSince we're on this point, let me also point that diversity is always a work in progress and world will never be equal. Too much randomness for it to happen.\n\nGujratis are overrepresented in business in India (Jews do it worldwide).\n\nBengalis are overrepresented in arts and literature\n\nSouth Indian brahmins are overrepresented in ISRO scientists.\n\nWhite men run silicon valley.\n\nBalancing needs to happen at the end of the govt not at the end of the businesses. Their KPI should be to improve this diversity. Change your leaders if that's not happening.\n\n\nAlso, just quoting famous Jordan Peterson argument here. If we're trying to bring inclusivity, lets also bring inclusivity to all professions, even dangerous ones. Let's aim to get more diversity in bricklayering and soldiers where men are over-represented. You can't have all the good of diversity without owning the bad with it.\n\nYou will get a lot of kudos for being politically correct but try running a business? :)",
