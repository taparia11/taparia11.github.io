Most founders I consult, just want content marketing without understanding the real, long term RoI. “We need a blog”. Lol. Which in turn means they’ll DEFINITELY NOT budget 50 lakh CTC for a mere “blogger”. \n2. Another reason is Indian marketers settling for less. But I can sense a shift. Hiring marketers in SaaS is becoming tougher. A recruiter recently reached out and after our CTC conversation she expressed her frustration. “I’ve been searching for this role for over 2 months now. A content marketer with 5+ years of work ex AND catering to the US audience is already a small pool and you folks are asking for a standard 40-50% hike, which is still way more than the maximum budget set for this role.” (Shoutout to my peers who didn’t settle!) She’s gone back to the management for a budget increase.\n3. It’s a slow shift, but if you refuse to settle for less, automatically you give other marketers a chance to aim higher and force companies to eventually increase their hiring budgets.",

A recruiter recently reached out and after our CTC conversation she expressed her frustration. “I’ve been searching for this role for over 2 months now. A content marketer with 5+ years of work ex AND catering to the US audience is already a small pool and you folks are asking for a standard 40-50% hike, which is still way more than the maximum budget set for this role.” (Shoutout to my peers who didn’t settle!) She’s gone back to the management for a budget increase."

If you cannot sell your stake, then you have to understand when will you see the wealth coming in (IPO etc.)\n\nIf you are unable to see a way to build your wealth through ESOP’s then you can definitely look at other orgs.\n\nStrategic Information is confidential - unless it is public knowledge would recommend not sharing\n\nLooking from an overall perspective - have a chat with former employees, glassdoor reviews or anon reviews about your competition.
