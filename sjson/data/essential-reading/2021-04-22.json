I also have a feeling that in the UK, financial consumers are better educated at an earlier age about budgeting and other concepts, so they’ve already been sold on the value of financial products. In the US, we’re absolutely (and I suspect, purposefully) left clueless about finances --there’s nothing in our educational system that requires such education-- and have to figure it all out on our own. So having a “peer” like a sassy AI budget assistant to help guide us in our young adult years may be more appealing to a US audience than a UK audience.",

I also have a feeling that in the UK, financial consumers are better educated at an earlier age about budgeting and other concepts, so they’ve already been sold on the value of financial products. In the US, we’re absolutely (and I suspect, purposefully) left clueless about finances --there’s nothing in our educational system that requires such education-- and have to figure it all out on our own. So having a “peer” like a sassy AI budget assistant to help guide us in our young adult years may be more appealing to a US audience than a UK audience."

People have debt problems and savings problems, at probably exactly the same rate as in the US.\n\nI think it's more culture related. In the US, people are a bit more sassy, easy going and are more used to apps with highly personalised customer experiences such as Amazon, DoorDash, Instagram, etc.\n\nIn the UK, we are prefer legacy or older brands because a lot of our banks are centuries old and that's what we're used to. I interviewed a fintech founder in the UK and this is what he said. I'm inclined to believe that's the right answer, but honestly it's difficult to say. The best would be to ask Cleo directly... All in all, it is a very interesting distinction and it shows that people react differently to product depending on the region.",
