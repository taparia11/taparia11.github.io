I definitely didn‚Äôt grab onto TikTok right away but now I spend quite a bit of time on there after seeing so many TikTok clips on Twitter and Instagram. I don‚Äôt make them and I probably never will, but I like watching.\n\nQuibi also failed with its super focus on celebrity talent. I don‚Äôt think most people would pay for another app to get short shows from celebs‚Äîespecially the younger generation they were trying to connect with. Celebrities very rarely move the needle for businesses. They could have spent the same budget on smaller creators who would have done way more promotion and helped make sense of the signup fee. With more creators, they would have had even more content on their app and a diversified subscription base.\n\nQuibi just needed a lot of help. I sort of feel bad for all the investors but I don‚Äôt because I feel like they could have done more research to understand if Quibi sounded like a good idea or not.",

With more creators, they would have had even more content on their app and a diversified subscription base.\n\nQuibi just needed a lot of help.
