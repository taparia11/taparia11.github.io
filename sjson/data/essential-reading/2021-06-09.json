Your original post about blogs not being a publication was always something we really leant into, but when Covid hit, and we noticed our audience was really wanting and needing up-to-date and super timely content (since our industry was so impacted by all the changing restrictions and regulations), we needed to shift gears a little. This content was distributed mostly through email and social, but I always wrestled with the fact that we had it sitting amongst all our really strong SEO pieces and guides. We decided to split these two types of content, which we're calling SEO content and editorial content into two separate destinations on site. So as you can see, I was pretty happy to read your newsletter this evening! Any advice from industry experts is always helpful. Thank you for what you do, Jimmy!",
