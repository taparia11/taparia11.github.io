I had no luck with job boards - it’s demoralizing to say the least. But there are a few resources I’d recommend:\n• Acadium really got me started. I learned a ton and it led to freelance clients (disclaimer - Acadium hired me as a contractor after I did two successful apprenticeships) \n• Linkedin \n—&gt; message people in your field. So many people are happy to help recent grads. I found my job through a cold LinkedIn message after seeing a job posting by them. \nthere are so many certifications for different roles out there to back up your resume. If they’re into content marketing try Hubspot as step 1. Then start guest posting (you can find people in this group)\nI wrote more about this in a <https:\/\/ryancarruthers.com\/index.php\/2021\/04\/08\/covid-graduates\/|blog> about graduating into the pandemic that they may related to and find a value in. \n\nAlso —&gt; if they’re looking for an <https:\/\/jobs.lever.co\/together\/e9c7982a-8a86-43bd-8f45-5215e7509c04|entry level sales> role at a startup were still looking for someone to join our startup, Together Software. They’ll work with ex Facebook, Hoootsuite, Boston Consulting Group, Unilever, TopHat and more. It’s approaching series A so it’s an exciting time to learn and grow. ",
