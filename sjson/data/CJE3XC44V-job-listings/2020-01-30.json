Essentially, your job is to help our customers fall in love with our product and get the most out of it.\nYou’ll be creating communications plans from scratch, so you’ll need to be proactive about identifying opportunities to promote the product and increase retention. You’ll also need to be a great project manager, as you’ll be collaborating with team members from across the marketing, product development, support and onboarding departments to bring campaigns to fruition.\nIn addition to running marketing campaigns, this role includes developing and managing product-related content on the website and developing content that helps trial users get up to speed on the product. You’ll also put together our monthly newsletter, so you’ll be making decisions on the key stories to share, collaborating with team members and customers, and creating the right messaging to communicate announcements.\nEvery day will be different: you might be launching a new feature, announcing a company update, or finding new ways to share information with customers. You will be publishing blog\nposts, writing copy for web pages, creating email campaigns and nurture tracks, running webinars and planning in-product messaging.\nFor this role, you’ll need to be passionate about trying out new features, understanding the product and our users inside and out, and increasing product usage and feature adoption. If you’re ready to help customers feel informed, empowered and inspired to use Wild Apricot, we’d love to hear from you!",
