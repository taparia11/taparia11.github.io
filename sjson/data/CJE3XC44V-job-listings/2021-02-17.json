We're looking for a content writer to take these fact-filled podcasts and produce high quality blog posts\/pages on <http:\/\/ExerciseCoach.com|ExerciseCoach.com> for SEO content and driving in qualified prospects to our cutting edge fitness concept studios.\n\nWe are reimagining our voice. We want to start producing insightful, valuable information to attract SERP traffic and convert them into leads. This means written content, listicles, infographics, and more. To start, we want help converting our podcasts into content. We do NOT want podcast-specific recaps (we already have that with show notes listed for each episode). Instead, we want clear, focused articles with SEO'd titles, that educate the prospect. Think of these as long-term content posted to our site.\n\nIf this sounds up your alley, here's what I want you to do!\n\n1.) Send me an email (<mailto:c.stanton@exercisecoach.com|c.stanton@exercisecoach.com>) with the subject line \"I'm the Content Marketer you've been dreaming of!\"\n2.) In the email, tell me about an experience you have that is similar to what we're requesting. \n3.) Share 2 writing samples. If they're in health and fitness, even better!\n4.) Answer these two questions:\n-- a.)  What about this job post is making you want to apply? Be honest! \n-- b.) If we met in 2 years from today and you were THRILLED about your life, both personally and professionally, what would you be doing? Where would you be living? Tell us this in 3-5 sentences with enough detail for us to taste your excitement. It would be a dream come true if we could help make your dream come true.\n\nThe best candidates will be given a paid test to transform 1-2 podcast episodes into content. If we like whatcha cook up, we'll offer you the rest, plus potential other content work (like our email newsletter, additional website content, and more!)\n\n\n*To apply, send an email to:* `<mailto:c.stanton@exercisecoach.com|c.stanton@exercisecoach.com>`",
