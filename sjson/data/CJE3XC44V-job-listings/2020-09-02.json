This person needs to be a go-getter, someone that sees what needs to be done before it’s asked.\n\nOur company is in the B2B space, specifically warehouse automation robots. Very exciting stuff, i thought i had it good at my last company but this one is a top-level go-getter with great pay and a passionate team that’s constantly excited at every win (because there are a lot!).\n\nIf you feel you’d like to throw your hat in the ring, you can do one of two things:\n• PM me a cover letter (I’ll review with the team and let you know whether we’d like to see a resume or kindly let you know it’s not a good fit)\n• submit your resume\/cover letter directly to <https:\/\/www.smartrecruiters.com\/LocusRobotics\/743999716607622-product-marketing-manager|Product Marketing Manager> or <https:\/\/www.smartrecruiters.com\/LocusRobotics\/743999717258086-general-job-inquiry-resume-submittal|General Inquiry> and be sure to include that i brought this job opening to your attention in the Message to Hiring Manger field\nA cover letter will go a long way to help us see why you’d be a good fit in words that extend beyond a typical resume scan, so I highly recommend spending the time on a paragraph or two with any job you apply for!",
