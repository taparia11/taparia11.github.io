My team and I at <http:\/\/jobportraits.com|Job Portraits> are building <http:\/\/beforeyouapply.com|beforeyouapply.com>, a content-first job board.\n\nWe’re looking for a consultant or advisor to help us set up analytics on our platform. We’re exploring what metrics matter, which tools to use, how to implement, etc.\n\nOur ideal partner for this project is someone who understands the recruiting space. But but but, the core of our product is content, so I think most folks in this group who are well-versed in metrics would be a fit here.
