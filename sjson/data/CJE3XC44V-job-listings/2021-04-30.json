Looking for someone that can help us as a brand stand out largely within existing customers to expand our footprint, meaning that - while search is an input - the writer won't be bound by restricting developing content for \"what ranks\". Capturing attention, and using that attention to get more meetings for our sales team, is the name of the game.\n\nBeyond \"writing well for audiences at different levels of seniority\", key skills are being able to build and execute an editorial calendar that blends SEO and buzzworthy \/ thought leadership content. Should be comfortable helping us restart the content engine in terms of establishing a content operations process (building out briefs, establishing a process to capture &amp; codify internal and external insights, building a tone\/style guide, etc.), as it's been a gap in terms of quality and consistency. Experience in interviewing executives to translate content into bylines is preferred, as is experience establishing a common voice across one to multiple internal writers (not all of whom may be skilled or experienced writers by trade).\n\nRemote opportunity, NY or TX preferred\n\n*Learn more and apply here:* <https:\/\/bit.ly\/3u69Wuy>\n\n<@URY0PS7HC>",
