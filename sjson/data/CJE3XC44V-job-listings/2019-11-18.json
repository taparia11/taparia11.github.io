Genbook is a scheduling tool for owner-operators in the beauty and wellness industry and we’re adding more verticals each day.\n\nOur primary readers are owner-operators— think barbers, salon owners, nail artists, lash artists, wellness coaches, experts and more. The ideal writer for us would be someone who can write on problem topics for these personas and\/or someone who can identify with them or has dabbled in that space. The engagement frequency will be 2-4 posts (keyword researched and SEO optimized) per month but may change as we launch our new brand.\n\nWe are looking for someone based out of the West coast in USA or someone in Australia\/New Zealand for better coordination.\n\nThis is an exciting collaboration opportunity and if this interests you DM me or email me at <mailto:tarub@genbook.com|tarub@genbook.com>",
