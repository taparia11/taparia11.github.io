That \"failed to convince others\" bit has happened quite a few times with me and it is supremely frustrating.\n\nTo distil my thoughts down, to the best of my current capabilities, I feel the following points help me in managing these feelings better:\n\n1) The core of it all is to learn - to fill the existing gaps and broaden &amp; deepen the breadth and depth of my current knowledge, respectively.\n\n2) If I am unable to convince others of my idea then I try to research and understand in detail why the other person's idea\/suggestion won over mine.

My ideas might seem better to me than others but I know they have gaps and flaws too. So better get to the bottom of it to make sure things are as fine in the end as they possibly can be. \n\n4) Whenever I feel the feelings that you have mentioned about, I just remind myself that my own ideas, however good they might seem to me, have\/can have\/may have gaps or flaws, like I mentioned earlier. Corollary that I draw from this - good ideas can come other people too, though even those may have their own set of flaws when put under the microscope, even though superficially it may have gathered traction and convinced most others\/concerned key stakeholder of its 'impactfulness'. At the end of it, whether it's my idea or someone else's, despite what I am feeling, i try to focus on getting the required results. But, quite a lot of things work under limitations and at the end of it you have to make do with what you have, if you can't improve the current system anyhow.\n\n5) When i feel down and I seem like a fraud to myself (the imposter syndrome you talked about), it helps to think about all the times I pulled stuff off successfully, know that I have a natural inclination to punch more holes in me and my thoughts, and remember the times when it felt so in the past but how that also just passed by. \n\nI tried to be as coherent as I could. Not sure about how successful I was. :sweat_smile:\n \nIn case you want to discuss this further, do connect. Would be happy to chat further on this.",

Then use my learnings next time I pitch something - be it in the structure of my pitch or\/and its contents.\n\n3) If I successfully convince others that my ideas\/suggestions\/proposals are the better option, I still try to get into the depth of it to understand how it can fail. My ideas might seem better to me than others but I know they have gaps and flaws too. So better get to the bottom of it to make sure things are as fine in the end as they possibly can be. \n\n4) Whenever I feel the feelings that you have mentioned about, I just remind myself that my own ideas, however good they might seem to me, have\/can have\/may have gaps or flaws, like I mentioned earlier. Corollary that I draw from this - good ideas can come other people too, though even those may have their own set of flaws when put under the microscope, even though superficially it may have gathered traction and convinced most others\/concerned key stakeholder of its 'impactfulness'. At the end of it, whether it's my idea or someone else's, despite what I am feeling, i try to focus on getting the required results. But, quite a lot of things work under limitations and at the end of it you have to make do with what you have, if you can't improve the current system anyhow.\n\n5) When i feel down and I seem like a fraud to myself (the imposter syndrome you talked about), it helps to think about all the times I pulled stuff off successfully, know that I have a natural inclination to punch more holes in me and my thoughts, and remember the times when it felt so in the past but how that also just passed by. \n\nI tried to be as coherent as I could. Not sure about how successful I was. "
