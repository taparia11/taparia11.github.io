The hidden reality is the technical work is pretty monotonous and there's no real career growth like handling a larger tech team or increased responsibilities etc. Industry standard is to outsource these kind of work to web designer services. Its cheap. The smarter chaps end up freelancing since industry doesnt pay them any higher. Sigh. I will try looking for another 2 months since my boss wants me to. If it doesn't work i guess i will ask her to get a project manager and continuing the outsourcing model.",
