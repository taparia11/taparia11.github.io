        "text": "Hey Cat, at first glance your portfolio looks clean and polished—good job! However, I’d like to see a line or two at the top of your profile explaining what you are especially good at. I think it can be a bit aspirational too. e.g., “I specialize in B2B writing for hard-to-understand products. I turn technical details into clarity for your customers, which means more $$$ for your business.” That’s not a great example; I’m sure you can do better :grin:\n\nAs someone who’s hired for content roles, I am quite picky about grammar &amp; style in content writing samples. From that perspective, I see room for improvement. For example, the first line on <https:\/\/catherinetreme.com\/portfolio\/project-4\/|this page> and the second paragraph on <https:\/\/www.budgetsmadeeasy.com\/how-to-live-below-your-means-without-going-crazy\/|this sample> have some grammar errors. If you’re not already using Grammarly, it’s a great option to help you improve grammar while you write. For the portfolio, you might even consider copying your old pieces into a Google Doc (so the text styling &amp; images are retained), and just rewriting the lines that need work. Just an idea. Hope this was helpful!",
