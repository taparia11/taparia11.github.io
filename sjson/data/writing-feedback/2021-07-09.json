The HR software for forward-thinking teams: This is a bit vague in terms of audience it’s addressing. It also requires a degree of self-awareness from visitors :slightly_smiling_face:  Could it be written to focus on the biggest thing an HR team will gain from using Charlie? What’s the top benefit for them?\n2. Love that it clearly says no credit card required and cancel any time below the CTA! My only thought here is that the CTA and point right below it are repetitive. Could the button say “Try free for 14 days” and then delete the first point?\n3. Graphic for Find freedom from HR admin: The left text (banish spreadsheets…) repeats what’s in the content for this section. The other points in all the graphics are complementary to the content. Could this one be written differently to complement the text instead of repeat it? Alternatively, you could leave it here and delete “No more clumsy email threads or messy spreadsheets.” from the content.\n4. Give your team the experience they deserve: This is again a bit vague. Could this be made more specific? I actually think “build an environment where [your team] can thrive” right below it might work better as a hook.\n5. (going below the testimonial now) Time Off: The content for this box\/feature “Let Charlie handle your time off admin for you” doesn’t share much about how, whereas all the others expand a bit on the feature.\n6. Reviews: This might be me, but “Help your team to grow personally and develop professionally” reads more Learning than Reviews to me.\n7. Perks: “Give your team the experience they deserve” same comment at point 4, and also that it’s repeated content on the page.\n8. Love the specificity of using the number 11,000!\n9. We designed Charlie specifically to help UK-based small businesses: Raises a few questions — If I’m not UK-based, can it still help me or not at all? And if it is specific for UK-based companies, could you share an example or 2 of how? Until here, it reads like it could be useful for anyone. So why should UK-based businesses in particular use Charlie?\n10. Love the team section (huge bonus for the dog in the pic!)\n11. Last CTA: 14-day reads easier than two week",
