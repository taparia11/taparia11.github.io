I think it really comes down to:\n*How much time are you wanting to put into the update and how do you want to spend your time?* Working with this template or trying to find another template will take some time - are you wanting to share the updated site with the world soon, or do you have a longer timeline? (I am in the process of launching my site and know how long it can take to navigate formatting, design, etc.) Also, I have a feeling that working in the current template will not get you to the place you want the site to be.\n\nWorking with a designer also takes some time, but you aren't trying to troubleshoot small details (e.g., what type of contact form to include) - instead your time spend is more about the overall look and feel, and then a designer does the rest.\n\nI'm not sure I have an answer -  but this is a question I would ask myself. With my launch, I didn't have the budget for a designer so I'm building a Wordpress site on my own, but I also don't have a specific timeline to launch. I hope that the above helps!",
