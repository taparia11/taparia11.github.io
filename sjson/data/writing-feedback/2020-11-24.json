Most of my freelance is per hour or project but I’m now going to be doing social media strategy for my friends band, which is fairly successful. There are no gigs to promote obviously but they have a new album coming out and need to promote the songs, digital stream\/downloads, etc. my thought is more around a monthly retainer type of fee but not sure how to charge for something like as it will be ongoing and sometimes more frequent than not. Looking for some ideas around structured billing and how you’d charge more than what $$ you’d charge. ",
