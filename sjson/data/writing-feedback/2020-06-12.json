I don’t know if it’s the way our dev configured it but I don’t like how articles\/tags\/authors\/homepage are all in one place and there isn’t an easier way to group things. it also depends on where you’re coming from. Before joining 360Learning I was using Hubspot for 4 years and I really loved the lead management aspect and the ability to track how content plays a role in the lead lifecycle. Prismic is just a CMS so I’m missing a lot of the lead gen capabilities of HubSpot. Having said that, it’s a huge upgrade from the custom CMS that I inherited which was a nightmare and I couldn’t make any changes without going through a developer.",

I don’t know if it’s the way our dev configured it but I don’t like how articles\/tags\/authors\/homepage are all in one place and there isn’t an easier way to group things. it also depends on where you’re coming from. Before joining 360Learning I was using Hubspot for 4 years and I really loved the lead management aspect and the ability to track how content plays a role in the lead lifecycle. Prismic is just a CMS so I’m missing a lot of the lead gen capabilities of HubSpot. Having said that, it’s a huge upgrade from the custom CMS that I inherited which was a nightmare and I couldn’t make any changes without going through a developer."
