I think you could bring “remotely or in person” even “for managers and their teams to get more from meetings, remotely or in-person” to your first line. “the app for managers and their teams to connect, remotely or in-person.” You could also add something to that second part that makes it clear all of this happens “all in one place.”\n\nOn another note, for me, as a ClickUp user, I find myself wondering what the differences are between the products. For example, does it record the meetings? Is it only for meetings or also for project management? This would be something more important for your actual launch page, not necessarily at this Upcoming Page, but definitely something you’ll want to answer for PHers.",
