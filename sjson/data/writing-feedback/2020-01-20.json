This was our \"seed\" content\n• We then shared these videos during the event and ran a giveaway internally for employees who published something on Twitter, LinkedIn, or Medium using the hashtag\nIn my experience, giveaways alone are very tough or lead to very sub-par content. In this case, we were all happy with the results. The executives basically set the bar of what kind of content was good, it gave people a more substantial starting point than \"just say anything!\"",
