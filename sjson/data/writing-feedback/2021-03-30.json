My niche is web and digital technologies and I usually draw upon my 15-year experience working as a web manager for nonprofits in my writings. I realize case studies and white papers require substantial research and information and might even require interviewing a subject matter expert.\n\nStarting from scratch I am drawing a blank on what to write about in my sample. I am seeking feedback and inspiration from content marketing managers on what would be good topics in the web and digital niche that would catch their attention and also what might be good potential sources of research, stats and information. Thanks for any feedback!",
