Here is some feedback, loosely organized from the first bits to the last:\n\nI Avoid Capitalizing Every Word But Sometimes The Client Insists.\n\nI'm finding it hard to imagine what \"an oasis for my pores\" means. It sounds... fancy. And I get that there's a nod to dryness here. But oases quench thirst vs moisturize. My dry pores don't have thirst but my skin may be flaky.\n\nGenerally the line has some \"show don't tell\" issues—in a few short words and in once sentence you're asking the Reader to parse two concepts (oasis, trip) and imagine it all. Maybe focus on one and try to find that 'show' element vs two 'tells.' Also, *I am not the target* for this line of products soooo my reaction might be a me issue. It's a fine sentence! I'm just trying to be nitpicky :)\n\n`With our line of rich pigments designed to bring out the goddess in every woman.` &lt; This is grammatically clumsy. I get that it's suppose to flow from the Headline, but even if the full sentence was `Crown your lids with our line of rich pigments designed to bring out the goddess in every woman.`  ~ you need a comma or probably a full stop after \"pigments\" in order to have good flow. But I'd strongly recommend avoiding having your headline and sub be related this way. Each should stand alone—both for better reading comprehension and because you never know what might be digitally hidden, mixed around, etc.\n\n\"Match the way you operate\" is an odd phrasing IMO. I don't think of \"the way I operate\" as something that is matchable, so I am more distracted trying to parse this vs being led effortlessly along the copy. Also, you use the word \"match\" twice in short succession, creating an echo. Something tighter might read: `We're property matchmakers. Learn what it's like to fall in love with an office space.`\n\nThis connects the idea of matchmaking with falling in love—a narrative that most folks should already have in their brains. You can have fun with the last line too... `We're property matchmakers. Ever fall in love with an office space before? No? That's about to change.`\n\n(Normally I don't love using rhetorical questions, but in this case the cheek felt worth it lol)\n\nMore general advice, especially with short copy, don't be afraid of using tiny, 3-4 word sentences vs. one long 12 worder. Crisp, punchy, easy-to-parse language works wonders everywhere, and probably even better in tight spaces.",
