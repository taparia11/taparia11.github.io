Of course, I hopped on to the first opportunity I could find that even remotely resembled my requirements. It's a B2C fashion brand, and my judgement was wrong. I've been on the prowl for a role where I can spread my wings a bit more, learn, and make meaningful content contributions. My approach to content is super-adaptable, and I'm looking for a new opportunity. I'd love some feedback, or some information on opportunities.
