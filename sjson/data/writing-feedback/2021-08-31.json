This is the second edit round and there are still many edits.\n\nDo you ever feel your self-esteem drop when you see the huge amounts of edits on a piece or is it just me? I mean, do you ever feel like you're a terrible writer and you should quit? \n\nI'm asking because that's how I feel right now. I've been freelancing for about a year now, but I just recently started getting bigger clients and I'm kinda scared to take on new gigs because I feel like I would do a terrible job. \n\nI'm just fishing for encouragement so please, help a sister out if you can. \n\nThank you!",

This is the second edit round and there are still many edits.\n\nDo you ever feel your self-esteem drop when you see the huge amounts of edits on a piece or is it just me? I mean, do you ever feel like you're a terrible writer and you should quit? \n\nI'm asking because that's how I feel right now. I've been freelancing for about a year now, but I just recently started getting bigger clients and I'm kinda scared to take on new gigs because I feel like I would do a terrible job. \n\nI'm just fishing for encouragement so please, help a sister out if you can. \n\nThank you!"
