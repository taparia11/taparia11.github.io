I’m trying to learn what features are most important for content marketers and would love feedback.\n\nSo far, we’ve heard: (1) export to WordPress and Markdown formatting, (2) better comments and built-in task management so action items don’t get lost among all the little changes, (3) the ability to create “variables” across all your content, so if you need to change one thing (a company name, a link), you do it once, not separately for every page.\n\nI’m curious if these sound useful, or if there are other, bigger challenges you’ve had when writing\/editing in Docs or Word? Thanks!",
