That being said, some clients want the cheapest (least editing) model but then nit-pick every other word. And yet others buy the most expensive model and barely change a thing. Every client will be different and this one may just not be on a good level for you. We have a client that honestly acts like he would rather just write the piece himself because nothing he is changing is actually critical and the longer we go back and forth - the more time this piece is not making them any money. Anyway - all this to say, you likely have your own writing style and it may not jive with this client’s expectations. Learn what you can, but don’t let it cramp your style. :blue_heart:",
