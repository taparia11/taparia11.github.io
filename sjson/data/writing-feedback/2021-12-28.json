The GIF is an awesome design, the only feedback there is the speech bubbles are a little hard to read (I’m on a desktop though so my screen makes it pretty small).\n\nAs for the wording, your first message that pops up on the page (I’m Johann, co-founder of Popwork) and the second message are a little repetitive. I’d consider changing one or the other slightly so you can take advantage of the characters and explain the value for users more, or even lists a few targets that this is for. Also, in the first message you’re calling Popwork an app, and the second, a platform. It could very well be both, but probably good idea to choose one (and if there is an accompanying app, perhaps mention that in the second slot).\n\nHope this is helpful!",
