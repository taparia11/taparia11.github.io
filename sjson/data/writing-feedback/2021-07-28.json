I don't know what problem you solve, just that you're yet another cloud thing that has to do with call centers.\n\n\"Looking for cloud-based call center software for your sales &amp; support teams? We've got you covered\" - this is redundant. The only new information is \"sales &amp; support teams.\" This subheader should be used to expand on the \"WOW interesting\" feeling the the headline evokes. Right now you have neither.\n\n(I am generally not a fan of rhetorical questions, I find their tone to too often be patronizing. There's a time and place for them, but here in your hero is probably not it.)\n\n\"You will hear the CloudTalk ringtone when calling\" - *THIS is brilliant.* A very original way to showcase clients using a narrative that everyone understands (ringtones).\n\n\"Over 2,500 call centers and phone systems are powered by CloudTalk\" -- kinda redundant after the brilliant line above. I'd honestly promote the ringtone line to a higher header and use this line as a secondary somewhere. This section is also kind of weirdly floating in white space. There's a teeny \"customer stories\" CTA near it, but THAT should be the thing that's highlighted if at anything at all.\n\nAt this point on the page I still don't know WHAT you do, exactly. \"Powered by\" -- what does that mean?\n\nVideo starts off with a grammatically flawed header: \"What Customers Love about CloudTalk?\" you're (a) missing the word \"do\" and (b) asking a rhetorical question again. This page needs to be proofread by a native English speaker!\n\n\"Maintain local presence with an international phone number and run your virtual call center from anywhere in the world.\" -- t*his is the first instance where I 'm getting a hint of what makes you different.* VIRTUAL call center, run from anywhere, using any number. Ohhhhhhh. This needs to be closer to the Hero or THE hero.\n\n\"Using advanced call center analytics, your team can measure and improve communication with customers. With real-time analytics, you can live track the performance of your agents.\" --- lots of generic jargon. Any analytical software does this.
