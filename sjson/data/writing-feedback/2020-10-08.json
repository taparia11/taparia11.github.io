Quick design thought: the combination of headers, typeface, and design elements above the fold (on desktop) ends up feeling heavy. It’s hard for me to know what to read first. Might be worth lightening up that area.\n\nDefinitely agree with <@U017XD7H4P7> about tightening up your offering. This is something I’m thinking about for my own website: If a visitor walked away with just one takeaway, what would it be? Maybe you can expand that to 3 takeaways, but the point is narrowing your scope and saying who your best-fit audience is. For example:\n\n• I’ll help your new company build the marketing foundation it needs for the next 5 years\n• I specialize in growing small businesses by generating more leads with your existing blog\n• I handle the marketing content your small business has been putting off, so you can focus on strategy\nThis isn’t great copy, but you get the idea. And then think about how you can carry that main takeaway through to your newsletter description, testimonials, etc. I hope that helps!",
