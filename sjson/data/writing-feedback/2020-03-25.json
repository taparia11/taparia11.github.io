You can create ads on multiple channels without the hassle of managing different ad platforms._\n\nOkay, so speed\/convenience is what I'm getting here.\n\n_Trust your ads with experts_\n_Backed by AI technology, our in-house marketing experts will manage your campaigns and proactively suggest better and more effective strategies. With Adriel, your ads are in good hands._\n\n\"AI\" - a concerning buzzword, but not a deterrent to me using this tool. But again I'm wondering how much I'll be using this tool myself and how much I'll need someone on your end to manage for me. Is this going to be a bottleneck? Will this service be expensive due to the human involvement? But I do like that I'm getting help with my ads.\n\n_Manage all in one place_\n_Manage ads and get reports from Facebook, Google and many other platforms. See beautifully aggregated data in one place. Get cross-platform insights you can't find anywhere else._\n\nI'm dubious about these insights. It'd be interesting to see a quick video that runs me through what they are and why that's valuable. I'd also like to see some social proof from existing users that this tool actually helps smooth reporting processes out, rather than just supplementing with a new report.\n\n_We're not just another expensive agency_\n_Not a fan of retainer? Neither are we._\n_Set your own budget. We'll take care of the rest._\n\nAhhhh, so it _is_ an agency, not a self-serve tool. I've been burned a little with agencies before, so I'm now wrestling with how much I need this.\n\n_Start with the plan that fits your needs_\n\nCool, this is helpful! But the \"19% on ad spend\" isn't what I just saw above about ad platform and services fees per day. I'm now confused about pricing.",
