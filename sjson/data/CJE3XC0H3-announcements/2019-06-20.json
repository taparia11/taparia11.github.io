(MP is their network of original films, video shows, and podcasts, and the team behind it). Curious to know:\n- Have you listened or watch any of their stuff? What did you think of it?\n- What's great? What's not so great?\n- What do you think they're trying to achieve? Does it fit their brand? Does it feel like a smart move?\n\nThis will launch tomorrow on the Marketing Showrunners blog. (We cover all things relating to the movement of brands making original series. Mailchimp is really ahead of the pack.)",

I could tell they had a well-developed persona they were targeting (video\/photography\/creatives who work for B2B\/B2C companies). Although I remember thinking, \"is this the idea audience for Mailchimp...?\"\n\nNot entirely sure what they were trying to achieve, I assumed it was a branding move to get people more engaged with the brand, sharing the videos around (which people were doing).\n\nIt's a smart move insofar as they're differentiating from their competitors, being the only one to go big on video and low-intent entertainment for their target audiences.

        "text": "It's a really interesting approach, as a lot of their marketing has been historically.\n\nMailchimp is one of the few SaaS companies to focus on reach as part of their marketing strategy (Squarespace is notable, and Shopify is starting to play in that arena as well).\n\nThe overall reach approach makes a TON of sense for them – most purchasers of lightweight email marketing aren't martech experts, and Mailchimp wouldn't be able to reach them with the digital marketing tactics that most saas orgs are using. In a sense, their approach is literally textbook – when I started reading some of the marketing research from the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute, I thought \"this is Mailchimp's entire marketing strategy.\" (The book How Brands Grow, by Byron Sharp, is a good overview).\n\nWhere does this fit in? I think it's also a long-term play for attention and reach. Most importantly, it's a way to capture attention on a channel that Mailchimp _owns_. It's starting pretty small now, but they potentially have the $$$ to turn these into valuable media properties.",

I watched the whole series because I'm a marketer who is super interested in what Mailchimp marketing, but would a potential buyer for support, sales, or developer software do that? eh...probably not.  So for the martech space I think it's phenomenal, it makes Mailchimp stand out from the million other ESP vendors out there. It's very on brand for them. It's funny and communicates \"we get you!\" But marketers who do not sell to other marketers should be very careful about adopting that same strategy to their business.",
