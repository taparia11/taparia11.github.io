Most of what I’ve seen is about sales alignment and executive buy-in.\n\nI bring this up because I learn a lot from teams that content marketers typically don’t work with. At Eventbrite, I was the advisor for our R&amp;D team, worked closely with data science and data strategy, and built strong bridges with legal and PR teams — all of which improved my ability to get stuff done while providing me with ideas and concepts that ultimately up leveled our content. \n\nAnyway, I’m not entirely sure how to package such educational material. But I’m personally invested in Superpath’s success and wanted to share my thought. ",
