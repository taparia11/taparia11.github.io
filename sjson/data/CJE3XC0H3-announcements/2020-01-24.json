I did numerous calls with the buyer explaining the how this _could work_ but would not be a great fit for what the software was designed for and they decided to go for it anyway.\n\nI was enticed because this would be the largest customer on board and might help with more traction. But we ended up spending way more money supporting them than they ever paid us.\n\n*Lessons:* \n1. If it’s not a good fit, don’t let the customer buy.
