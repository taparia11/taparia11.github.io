        "text": "I think about all these things a bunch, and I’d be very interested to continue to hear what other folks have to say. But my answers:\n\n- Jocelyn K Glei was my editor early in my career and had a profound impact on me and my writing. She doesn’t work in the space any more, though!\n- I leave a lot of comments and edits. Not (only) to shape the piece, but to help the writer better understand their own thinking. <@UJWJLLD63> made a gif from my edits here, once: <https:\/\/twitter.com\/LenMarkidan\/status\/978681745200549889>\n- For improving writing, this is hard, because most shops mostly use freelancers. I find it most useful to quickly find a writer’s strengths and career ambitions and do everything in your power to align their assignments to that. It won’t be all the time, but it’s like picking a basketball team. If someone is good at shooting 3's… position them by the 3-point line. If a writer is good at interviews, give them all the interviews you can.\n- Here is the order of how I edit pieces <https:\/\/twitter.com\/SeanBlanda\/status\/1149351138036203520>\n\nI hope this helps! And I admit there’s no way to answer this question as an editor that doesn’t come across as self-centered. Apologies if that’s the case here :pray:",
