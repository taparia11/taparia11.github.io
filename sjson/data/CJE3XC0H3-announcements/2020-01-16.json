She's offering two template bundles, one for freelance writers (includes templates for onboarding emails, writing briefs, client screening, and proposals) and another for editors and content managers (includes templates for screening writers, writing briefs, onboarding decks, and a style guide). She also has a great ebook packed with actionable writing advice.\n\nI worked with Kaleigh to give early feedback on some of her templates - they're really well put together, and they're a great headstart for anyone looking to bost your freelancing efficiency or scale up production without headaches.\n\nYou can check out more on her template packs on her site: <https:\/\/www.kaleighmoore.com\/products>\n\n_(PS: even if these aren't something you need right now, I'm sure Kaleigh would appreciate a quick shout-out on Twitter to help spread the word!)_ :the_horns:",
