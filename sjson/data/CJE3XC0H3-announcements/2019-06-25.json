I felt like the quality of the content was very high, which reflects on the quality of the brand and product for me.\nI’m already a huge fan of Mailchimp (although like <@UJG12DM1V> said, it’s probably mostly me as a marketer enjoying their marketing), but the content endeared me to the brand even more.\nI would be really curious to know how they’re tracking the success of these projects though. Purely on brand value or are they also hoping to wiggle their way towards leads?",

(not just what number, but how you decided on that number and who had to agree to it)\n\nFeel free to reply to this thread (I'll reply with how we do things at ActiveCampaign) – but if you're interested and want to DM me I'd absolutely love to chat on the phone.",

Our strategy is to focus on product-related (but not product-specific) searcher intent to grow traffic, with the goal of increasing traffic while holding conversion rate to free trial relatively steady.\n• I lead the team and have 4 direct reports (all writers). We also have internal design and social media teams. I have standing meetings with sales\/social\/acquisition, and we have a form for content requests that's connected to Airtable via Zapier\n• Organic traffic to our blog, month over month (with the caveat of steady conversion rate). Chosen because of our reach requirements (we have 75k customers) and the fact that leadership will always want to see conversion numbers. Our VP of Marketing signed off on this, and I ran it past our Director of Acquisition as well.",

        "text": "Hey guys, (<!here>) I’m trying to investigate one case and I’d love to hear your voice. There’s a fast growing e-commerce business that started to operate internationally around 1,5 year ago - but only in Europe. They launched multiple domains – ccTLD – to target specific markets granularly .de \/ .it  \/ .fr and so on. (this sounds reasonable).\n<http:\/\/example.de|example.de> ; <http:\/\/example.fr|example.fr> ; <http:\/\/example.it|example.it> ; <http:\/\/example.es|example.es>; and so on\n\nThe most problematic thing they did – *they launched “<http:\/\/co.uk|co.uk>” to differentiate UK traffic from “.com” – EN English\/ Europe*. This move sounds smart as they need to produce and ship products locally – so that they have to build a local online presence in GB.\n\nAlthough canonicals were set correctly (as they claim) some issues with EN keyword rankings started to occur and they lost some traffic for “.com” domain.\n\nApparently, the country switcher on “.com” domain blocked Google bots, so Google stopped to index the homepage for a while.\n\nAs a result they lost some visibility in the SERPs and some of positions were taken over by <http:\/\/co.uk|co.uk> domain.\n\n*The BIG question* is what to do to overcome this impasse and avoid keywords cannibalisation between .com and .<http:\/\/co.uk|co.uk>?\n\n-&gt; Do they need to keep the structure as it is now and realize two different SEO strategies for com and uk?\n\n-&gt; Or they should merge the domains (uk + com) - move \/uk to a subfolder? – If yes then what with the rest of ccTLD they use? .de ; .it .fr and so on...\n\nAll resources and replies appreciated :slightly_smiling_face:",
