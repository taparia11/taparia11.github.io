I’ve spend days labouring over persona’s and what not, only for them to collect dust in a folder. Even simply asking a prospect a question on Linkedin has helped me a lot (Hi, I’m working on an article about xxx, I noticed this is your expertise, so I was hoping you could help me out. I’d like to understand what...why... how... xxx?). When you appeal to peoples expertise most are actually pretty happy to respond I find. Also, a great little trick that I use, is to go through the job postings for,  and linkedin profiles of, the people you hope to reach with your content. There is always something in there that tells you what the pain point is they need solve. I’m a one-man content team, so I don’t always have the time do elaborate interviews with sales, csm and leads, but this trick has always been helpful to me.",
