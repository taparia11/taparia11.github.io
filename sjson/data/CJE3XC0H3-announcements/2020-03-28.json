        "text": "Thanks for asking Tara,\n\nIn FB platform,\n1. you need to know what is the Business manager\/ Account manager\/ Campaign level\/ Ads level \/ Ads set level.  - All the different layers of steps you need to take until you finally get to the ads creation stage.\n2. Then you also need to choose which images to use and Copywriting that won't be disapproved by the platform under strict regulation.\n3.  Then you will need to keep monitoring the data and need to know how to see the data to come up with the next move to keep high exposure.\nBut in Adriel,\n\nOnce the customer puts the landing URL, Adriel crawler generates the campaigns for FB, Google, IG, and Yelp (from April) on one page. All the images used in the campaign gets automatically cropped to fit the different size of the banner.\n(Of course little of fix is suggested to make it more appealing to customers)\n\nAlso, our system automatically detects the area has a high potential of disapprovement, then Adriel manager fixes it ourselves or reaches out to customers to changes the creative.\n\nOnce the campaign launch, everything else is on Adriel. The customer just needs to watch the result and its spending.\n\nso, Many small agencies use Adriel to provide extra value to their customers. :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n*Would you know anyone interested in Adriel service?*",
