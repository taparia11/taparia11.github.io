As a small agency owner who recently posted a job posting for a Product Marketing Associate Contractor, wanted to share feedback that I wouldn't personally pay $49 for a job posting. If I were a normal sized company positing a full time position, I would! But just not in my specific situation of having a team of part-time freelancers (we have a \"collective\" model). Hope that helps! Happy to help brainstorm further if you want but also get that you might want to stick to this since it suits for most needs.",
