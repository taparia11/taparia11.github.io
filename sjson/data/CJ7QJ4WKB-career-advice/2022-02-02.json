I’m a freelance content writer, and that’s where I get the bulk of my new clients, mostly inbound. I’ve found a lot of success connecting with other writers and content managers, commenting on posts and being helpful wherever I can. Generally, building a solid network of other freelancers is a great way to gain access to more referrals, since a lot of us busy writers like to share other freelancers that may be a good fit for prospects who reach out when we don’t have bandwith to help ourselves.

If you want, I’d be happy to connect and take a look at your page and offer some feedback. I’m a freelance content writer, and that’s where I get the bulk of my new clients, mostly inbound. I’ve found a lot of success connecting with other writers and content managers, commenting on posts and being helpful wherever I can. Generally, building a solid network of other freelancers is a great way to gain access to more referrals, since a lot of us busy writers like to share other freelancers that may be a good fit for prospects who reach out when we don’t have bandwith to help ourselves. Just a few thoughts!"
