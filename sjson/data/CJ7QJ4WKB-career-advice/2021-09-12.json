The growth so far has been via community, word of mouth, etc.\nOne way to help you assess whether their goals are realistic is contextualize their current WoM growth rate. How long did it take them from launch to ~$1m ARR? \n\nFor comparison, the founding team behind <https:\/\/retool.com\/|Retool> was able to reach ~$1m ARR very quickly, before they made their first outside hire. They launched 3 years ago and are now at $10m+ ARR. Although Retool is also in the dev tools space, it is important to keep in mind that their ACV is significantly higher (at $20k vs $600).\n\n\n&gt; ​Is it possible to scale 5x with no paid marketing i.e via Referral, Community, etc? (else, I might risk my job due to performance issues).\nIt’s not really clear what you mean by “no paid marketing”. It can either mean they don’t plan to target developers by placing ads (a perfectly reasonable stance when selling to the developer crowd <https:\/\/pages.apigee.com\/global-ebook-developers-hate-marketing-register.html|https:\/\/pages.apigee.com\/global-ebook-developers-hate-marketing-register.html>) or, there wont be a budget to fund marketing efforts (a serious handicap).\n\nAssuming the former, the answer really depends on what x itself is. Growing 5x, from 20 customers to 100 sounds doable in 3 years, but it gets harder when x is a really large number like growing from 1000 to 5000 customers. \n\nSo an important question is, is demand for the product category itself growing exponentially? You can get a sense of how their search terms correlate with broader terms using Google Trends.\n",
