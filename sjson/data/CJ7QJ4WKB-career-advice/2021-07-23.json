I’ve heard very mixed reviews from Acadium participants; it seems like, as with most things in life, you get out of it what you put in :wink:  glad it’s been helpful for you!!\n\n————\n\nMy answer:\n1. Pick companies you’re excited to write for\n2. Do the work, and pitch it to ’em\n3. Offer to write more for them :smile: \nDirectly building relationships with potential clients by creating value—no need for intermediary platforms.\n\nWith that said, yes, any writing samples you can provide are absolutely helpful for hiring managers to see what you can do. The more relevant to their industry, the better. Again, my recommendation is to make them an offer like, “I’ll write the first one for you for free, and if you like it, hire me for more”\n\nProve your abilities, and build human relationships. :raised_hands:",
