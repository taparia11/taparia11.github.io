I spent 20+ years as a design strategist, where, because I'd always identified as a writer first, I tended to take a content-forward approach to most of my work. When it comes down to it, strategy really is about writing anyway, and UX depends as much on language cues as it does visual. I'd be happy to chat and offer any insight about finding fit for writing and content marketing skills within a design team. Drop me a DM if you like!",
