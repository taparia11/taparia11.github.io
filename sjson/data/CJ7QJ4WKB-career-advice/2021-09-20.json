        "text": "Hello Superpath community!\n\nWe have a new \"Dear Superpath\" question. This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: senior (8+ years)\n\n\"I'm currently a Content Director at a B2B company. I have worked really hard but I am grateful to have the title and salary I have, and I almost feel terrible complaining at all. I started as a freelance SEO writer 10 years ago, and have increased my income 10x in that time. I was promoted last year and now lead a team of 12. To many it would seem I have my dream job, and two years ago I would tell you this is my dream job, but in the day to day it does not feel like it.\n\nWhile I love my team, I’m not in love with the company. In fact, I’ve had some very negative experiences at all of my full-time in-house roles, and have found that I’m constantly swimming upstream to get customer-centric content marketing implemented. The companies I’ve worked at have a focus on lead numbers over everything else. My current role is less about leading content strategy and more about being an order-taker for the executive team. People who don’t fall in line are eventually let go or they leave. So I try to do what I’m told to do, but also try to do extra work that shows the value of other philosophies of content marketing, but it’s exhausting. In short, I don’t feel that I can do my best work where I am, and I know I am burning out. \n\nI’ve been keeping an eye on job postings to see if anything catches my eye, but I feel a little jaded that the next job will be just like my past few. I’m curious to hear the group’s thoughts on what I consider to be my options: a) just try to stick it out for another year or so while I use my nice-sized salary to pay off my school debt, b) go hard at looking for a better company where I feel my marketing philosophy and personal values align closer, c) slowly replace my salary with side projects\/consulting gigs and then eventually quit (something I would love to do to have more freedom over my day, but I know there are other struggles with freelancing having done it before) \n\nJust curious to see the perspective of others!\"",

If you had a VP on Mktg, they should be running defence for you. You can let some pet projects\/asks through to keep them appeased, but you need to have a way to say ‘no’ to things too. Having a strong strategic plan they’re bought into early * should * help you say “that’s a great idea but you already agreed to this”, so that planning and those goals are important to clarify. …but it can still be hard to prevent “shiny object syndrome” from letting people forget it and start pummelling new asks your way.\n\nI HATE leaders like this. Can’t stand to be micro managed. So this is my personal hell, so I feel ya. But not all leaders and companies are like that. Try looking at companies with more established leaders decent base marketing strategies, and make sure to ask them questions about what they know about how marketing\/content should be runn before you join.

My current employer gives me tons of freedom and little oversight to do my thang. I find startups\/small companies can be the worst for this.\n\nAs to what you should do now…if staying for financial reasons is best, you could maybe assign one of your writers to be the c-suite ghost writer full time. (Someone will probably love this.) Then I’d keep a few folks focused on the content you know you need to make. Hopefully this way c-suite is appeased\/keeping somebody busy with stuff they thing is important, and you’re getting the work you want done--while you quietly look for that other role, network, beef up your portfolio\/resume, build your own business, etc.\n\nAt the end of the day, if you are depressed and truly miserable (I’ve had annoying bosses, then I’ve had toxic bosses--there’s a difference) no job is worth your mental health and wellbeing.  But I can say that working extra hours to do more work that no one appreciates (even though you know it’s important) is probably burning you out more and not leaving you time to figure out your next move. I would just do what they’ve asked, work 9-5, and work on my next thing…\n\nThat as a lot of conflicting advice, but you’re not alone!  Hope some of this is helpful. Good luck figuring things out.",
