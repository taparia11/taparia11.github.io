This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: junior (1-3 years of experience)\n\n\"Hi all,\n\nsorry that this Q is long and possibly sad sounding. I'm looking for advice on disclosing mental illness in the workplace. Or just making it work without disclosure. \n\nContext is that when things last got severe, after coming to terms with my declining performance, I cited \"health reasons\" and took an extended leave of absence. That's too extreme a measure! Got a new treatment plan which has been a tremendous help since, but it's still early and symptoms flare up often. \n\nRealistically, are there any accommodations or considerations to ask for? Is it ever useful to mention, particularly in the context of freelance\/contract arrangements?  \n\nThis has hampered my career since the beginning &amp; it's something I'll continue to struggle with. So I'd be grateful to hear your advice or experiences. Thanks everyone. \"",
