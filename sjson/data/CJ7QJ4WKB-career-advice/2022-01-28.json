        "text": "Agree on asking, no matter what your level.\n\nI’m going to share some equity basics, in case they’re useful to other content folks:\n\n• It’s important to understand how much of a percentage of the company you’re actually getting (or getting options to buy). For example, say they issue 1 million shares and you own 100,000. That’s much better than if they issue 10 million shares and you own 100,000.\n• Your strike price also matters, because you potentially profit from the spread between a sales price for a share and how much you have to pay for it (that’s the strike price). There’s no guarantee that your options will end up being worth anything, though.\n• Depending on which stage you join at, there might not already be levels and an associated range of equity. The earlier stage the startup, the more free they tend to be with equity — being an exec isn’t necessary. Mostly, they’re compensating for the risk you take by joining early. Of course, this varies by company.\n• Worth noting: Even after startups set levels and ranges, everything is still negotiable, depending on supply vs. demand for your skills and how badly a company wants you. That doesn’t require being an exec. It’s all about how much potential business value you’d add. Like there are IC technical or product folks who are so valuable that they have negotiating leverage. This is harder for content people in general, but varies with perceived value.\n• Most startups fail, so depending on your comfort and confidence level, you might want to weigh cash more. But I’ve worked with a number of financially savvy people who valued equity more, as I do. That’s company dependent, of course, and varies with individuals’ personal finances and risk tolerance. \n• It helps to know how to pick better startups, and relatedly, if you’ve built a strong track record in your roles, you tend to get recruited more often by better startups. That’s because they figure if you’ve succeeded before, you stand a better chance of doing it than folks who haven’t proved themselves yet. Companies will pay more for lower risk.\n• Past really early stage, many startups offer equity to all employees. Depending on how much cash you get, equity will vary. But companies will always try to compensate at market value. So for instance, if your market value is $100k annually, then they might give you $90k in cash and $10k in options (or some other combo that totals $100k). Logically, they won’t go over your market value, or they’d be overpaying you.\n• Of course, market value and hiring aren’t scientific, so sometimes perceived value can influence what employers will offer. Some people come across as more competent and negotiate better, so sometimes they end up making more. (Bias can affect pay as well, course. That potentially includes race, sex and age.)\n• You can never control others’ prejudices, but you can build strong negotiating skills. That’s worth noting for anyone who’s not comfortable discussing compensation — they’re skills worth learning.\nFWIW, as a content leader, I’ve negotiated for a seat at the exec table (at NerdWallet, because I knew I’d need that to deliver significant business value), cash, equity, annual bonus, signing bonus, title and moving costs. (Currently, I get the venture capital version of equity — carry, which allows me to participate in the returns of startups we invest in.)\n\nDuring both of my jobs in tech (my first career was in daily news), I’ve received increases in equity even when I wasn’t being promoted, simply because they wanted to retain or reward me. That can happen with various people at startups, across functions. I also got increases in equity when promoted. I originally started at director level when I changed careers and I negotiated equity even then.\n\nJust remember: Any “rules” or practices involving equity were decided by people and they can change them or make exceptions if they think it makes business sense. Nothing is etched in stone.",
