I think your perspective is one that many employers and people in general are sensitive to, because a ton of folks suffered with mental health during pandemic life.\n\nIt’s up to you whether you want to share that you were let go or if you moved on… but just make it more about your positive next steps forward. Like, “I’m looking for a role that will support balance in my life” or something like that.\n\nSounds like the transition wasn’t too long ago, so you may not need to explain yourself at all! Hope this was helpful.",

I think your perspective is one that many employers and people in general are sensitive to, because a ton of folks suffered with mental health during pandemic life.\n\nIt’s up to you whether you want to share that you were let go or if you moved on… but just make it more about your positive next steps forward. Like, “I’m looking for a role that will support balance in my life” or something like that.\n\nSounds like the transition wasn’t too long ago, so you may not need to explain yourself at all! Hope this was helpful."

Still, I was very nervous that I didn't have a lot of results or things to show from that job, and I was soooo concerned nobody would ever want to hire me again. In fact, that fear kept me in the toxic job a whole year longer than I should've been. I don't regret anything, but I look back at how misguided that fear was and I wish I could tell past me to trust myself to figure it out. Would've saved a lot of sleepless nights.\n\nFast forward, I literally got recruited, shortly after leaving, to a better job with better pay, better benefits, better opportunities, and none of the toxicity of the last gig. Here are some things I think helped:\n\n• I reached out to my network when I left the role and was top of mind for <@UJ7RT1J1X> to recommend me to my current gig when the hiring manager asked him for potential candidates (thanks again!!) It's hard to ask for help but people want to help you, I've seen it again and again!\n• When discussing my past job and why we parted ways, I was honest without throwing them under the bus. I basically said I was grateful for what I learned there but that it was no longer a good match and that had created friction that was really affecting my mental health, so I left to recharge. All four people who interviewed me asked, and none of them dug any deeper after I gave that basic response. I think we over-anticipate how judgmental hiring managers will be but they're human too and they understand this happens. We have all burned out before. (And if they don't understand, that's a :triangular_flag_on_post:)\n• Because I knew I didn't have a lot of results at my last role, I did a TON of research on the new role and came to each interview armed with my general diagnosis for the content operation’s wins and losses, along with a few specific things I would do to fix them. Hiring manager loved this, I even bought a month of Ahrefs to analyze their top performing pages. We spent 80% of the interviews discussing these ideas and my content philosophy. It makes sense if you think about it, he cared about the problems he had to solve more than the problems I solved for other people in the past. \n• This approach necessarily prioritizes quality over quantity in the job search, but I personally would take that approach no matter what. Blasting resumes into the void seems to still be the advice a lot of people still give, but that's in opposition to everything that has worked for me in the past\n• I knew I would eventually have to talk about my past performance, so I dug deep to find my three top performing projects at my last job and analyzed them from every angle I could to figure out how I could position them in the most favorable light. In my experience, you need a project that generated tangible results, a project that was challenging but ultimately successful and a project you worked on with others at minimum to cover the kinds of “past experience” questions that get asked. Also use the <https:\/\/www.themuse.com\/amp\/advice\/star-interview-method|STAR method> to handle these types of questions to present them in the best light. Again, the key is spending most of the time on what you would do at the new role and using these examples to reinforce that (or to answer if directly asked about past projects)\n• I had what a mentor once called an “art gallery” which is basically what <@U024QUK2AVD> mentioned. It's a huge help for imposter syndrome and interview prep, and it's never too late to make one.\nDM me if you want to chat further with someone who gets it :blush: I'm happy to be a resource in your job hunt and take a look at your samples or offer more specific advice on the roles you're applying to. Might even be able to connect you with some other folks I know.\n\n",
