(i edited encyclopedias for three years before getting into marketing.) that's made me a pretty quick study of new topics and, more importantly, hyper-aware of what i don't know\/when i know enough to write confidently\/when i should shut up and quote others\/who's a trustworthy source\/etc. i'm also pretty organized (imagine updating multi-million-word encyclopedia sets over the course of a year) and have good SEO knowledge (did pure SEO at an agency for ~3 years).\n*what i'm not good at:* i probably enjoy the _content_ side more than the _marketing_ side. i add too much context. i need to shorten more sentences. i'm not a great promoter. i see people who thrive there and are far better than me---and that there's tons of business value in that. i'm also a behind-the-scenes guy; i do well one-on-one and enjoy being an anonymous influence behind good content but am probably not a \"face of the company\" guy, which is why i work for entrepreneurs and am not one myself.",

So I’m the lone full-time marketing team member (for now!).\n*what i’m responsible for*: Building an audience. In marketing terms it’s “building our top of funnel” I’m responsible for our messaging and most public-facing video, audio, blog posts, and social. In metrics, that means email subscriptions, event attendees, pageviews. I also try to track what I call “seagulls” aka signs we’re “close to shore” such as sales team tell me content helped close a deal, or high profile people reaching out saying they like our content.\n*how my week breaks down:* 40% writing \/ editing, 15% interviewing \/ chatting with people in our target audience, 25% building yet-to-be-released content programs, 20% etc.\n*what’s great about this:* Building an entire content org and team from scratch! That’s fun to me. I enjoy the team building and strategy side.\n*what sucks:* There’s no way around it, the start of any audience building project is a slog. And when you’re one person, you have to do everything. The numbers are small and growth takes a while. Providing your value can be a challenge and patience is a virtue! Also, I’m a newcomer to this niche, so it’s a steep learning curve and I feel like a total newbie.",
