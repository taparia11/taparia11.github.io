As someone who’s had the experience of being edited by you <@UKAK6J1NY>, I think you did a great job with providing clear feedback and being compassionate enough to explain why the changes were needed.\n\nGranted, this was a one-time experience, but while reading about your experience I thought you were being hard on yourself. As other people have mentioned here, sometimes people are more sensitive to feedback, especially when someone has just started a new job (if it’s a new hire) and takes this feedback as criticism of their skills overall. I think a 1-on-1 with her explaining that your reasoning for giving so much feedback and reiterating that you’re not criticizing her skills in general but trying to improve a particular piece of writing should be helpful. If that’s not though, I think the problem is with this particular employee,  not your editing style :shrug:",

As other people have mentioned here, sometimes people are more sensitive to feedback, especially when someone has just started a new job (if it’s a new hire) and takes this feedback as criticism of their skills overall. I think a 1-on-1 with her explaining that your reasoning for giving so much feedback and reiterating that you’re not criticizing her skills in general but trying to improve a particular piece of writing should be helpful. If that’s not though, I think the problem is with this particular employee,  not your editing style "
