I was also asked to send my resume and portfolio, which I did right away.\n\nThere's this question that the CEO asked, that I think I didn't perform well: What will you be doing for us (that's in terms of content writing and blogging, and what type of content do you suggest we work on)? This is a great question because they haven't had a content writer (this could be their first role)\n\nSo I'm thinking about sending a content plan as a follow up, after researching their website more. Like the types of content I would write about, how we could tackle distributing these content - social media and other forms, etc.\n\nDo you think this is something I should do? And if so, what do you think I should also include?\nI want to make it a bit comprehensive, but not too much.\n\nWould really appreciate advice from the community.",

I think in the context of a conversation with the CEO, and at a company that doesn't have any content staff, I expect they were mostly interested in how content fits into a larger go-to-market and revenue strategy.

Maybe you can identify some quick wins (sales collateral, high-engagement social posts, etc.) and long-term plays (SEO, brand building, etc.). At least that's how I'd think about it!",
