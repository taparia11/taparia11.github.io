This is a way for folks to ask anonyous questions. \n\nCareer stage: senior (8+ years)\n\n\"I've had a 15-year career in the US focused on web technology and being a  content manager, digital marketing manager, and project manager for nonprofits. I want to change direction to focus more on setting the foundation for becoming a B2B content marketing writer and editor. My ultimate goal is to be location-independent and be able to live anywhere in the world and earn an income that one usually gets from North American or European companies. What would be the best way to transition to a more writing and editing focused role? I currently do freelance writing on the side and am trying to gain some practice on SEO and keyword research in my current role.   \"",
