        "text": "Depends on your definition of “made it big” but yes I know successful content marketers for whom English is not their first language because I have hired some of them. And it has definitely been harder for them, but not impossible. I do think they probably have had to work harder to “pass” in most contexts, but in my experience as a hiring manager native English speakers make just as many mistakes as non-native speakers. Nobody is guaranteed perfection from a native English speaker. And any company that says they prefer native English speakers is really just being discriminatory, in my opinion.\n\nSince you are earlier in your career, you would benefit either way from working with a team or at the very least a manager or editor who can give you feedback on the parts of your writing that stand out as obviously “incorrect” to native English speakers. Every content marketer, especially earlier in their career, needs training in one or more areas, so I don’t really see this as being much different. Through compassionate editing and feedback, you will start to improve your writing even more over time. Again, perfection is less important than 1) coachability and 2) the ability to improve through that coaching.\n\nUntil then, if you have friends who are native English speakers, perhaps ask them to take a look at your resume, cover letter, and writing assignments to give you good feedback and tell you if anything stands out to them. Ask people you really trust to give you honest feedback.",
