I am at an interesting point where demand is outstripping supply. I want to grow into an agency but I'm not sure how. I do both B2C and B2B writing; with B2C it's easier to scale since I also do the marketing side of things and I can outsource the writing, but with B2B it's harder since I only do the writing.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips or know any resources where I could find out more? Like Alyssa, I'm also keen to find a content marketing mentor or someone who has experience managing an agency who does mentoring.",

(Without this, you wind up in blech situations where your subs want money that you don't have because a client is running 60 days behind on your arrears, net-30 invoice)\n• Develop internal SOPs and find various ways to offer value that your freelance subs won't (e.g. errors and omissions insurance) so that clients and subs have an incentive beyond \"not being gauche\" not to cut you out of the middle.  (The other way to effect this would be with contracts, but I prefer the option that adds rather than subtracts, value, myself)\n• Prepare to be blown away by how unreliable subs can be, and plan accordingly.
