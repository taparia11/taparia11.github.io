Since i've been here for about 3 months, I'm a little afraid to ask for more $$ so fast but since they were asking for more things to be done, I requested an assistant and I got one :slightly_smiling_face: so that helps a LOT. When time passes, as we can give our team more value, I'm thinking about asking for someone else, a journalist for PR or something like that, so I can safely share the amount of work I have.",
