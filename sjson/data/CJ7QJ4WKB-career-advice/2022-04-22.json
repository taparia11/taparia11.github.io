I am a content writer and have been working over Upwrok for over a decade now (thats basically my entire school and college tenure). For some reason I never pursued high paying job, and I am trading hours for $$ which is pretty frustrating and demotivating now. I have a diverse set of skills because during the 10+ years I worked as a VA and Writer, both. But the clients I connect with are often in the lower middle category.  I want to move up in the game and meet my goal of making 3000 usd a month! This would be a dream come true for me. But I am at a loss of what to do. I dont wanna email existing clients with higher rates because I know they wont raise the price. So where can I look for better remote positions?

Pick various people who know you and your work well, people whose judgment you trust, who have different thinking than yours and ask them what they think your highest and best use might be careerwise. Ideally, these are progressive big thinkers, visionaries who AREN’T in your domain.\nThat doesn't mean do necessarily whatever they suggest. It's to potentially broaden your horizons, see things you might not.\n\n2. In parallel, tap leaders in your domain who know the landscape well and get their POV on what will unfold in the next decade or so. That's so you can make better informed career decisions, come up with stronger strategic thinking. Note: You don't necessarily need to know such folks; you can consume their content about such thinking.\n\n3. Whether you're job hunting or not, keep track of the job market, the compensation landscape. If you don't already do this, you should catch up. That's because the market keeps evolving and the only way to make informed career decisions related to that is to keep track. That includes what's in demand, what's starting to emerge, who your competition is for jobs and how you stack up, what skills you might need to build or strengthen.\n\nRemember that career strategy should be macro AND micro. If not, you can't see the forest and trees.\n\nI also suggest continuously leaning into discomfort. Dare to suck at new things. If you do that consistently, not only will you build new skills, you'll also become braver about taking risks, with proportionate potential rewards.",
