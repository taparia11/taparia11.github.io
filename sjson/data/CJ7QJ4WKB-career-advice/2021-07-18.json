This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: junior (1-3 years of experience)\n\n\"Seeking advice on how to develop writing samples that will be attractive to content marketers and content marketing managers in industries such as B2B, Saas, tech startups. I am willing to volunteer or work pro bono and I've found some volunteer writing opportunities on platforms like: <https:\/\/www.catchafire.org\/> or <https:\/\/www.taprootplus.org\/>. Most opportunities in the platforms are for nonprofits and social causes. Do industry marketing managers see the types of writing experiences based on these platforms as valid experience for industry content marketing writing? If not, what would you recommend to develop clips and writing samples for industry when you are starting out with little to no industry experience but have writing ability, research skills, basic SEO knowledge and a willingness to learn?\"",
