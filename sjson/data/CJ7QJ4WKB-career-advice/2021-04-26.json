This is a way for folks to ask anonyous questions. \n\nCareer stage: mid (4-7 years of experience)\n\n\"I'm looking at job posting for the first marketing hire at a small startup and I'm interested in trying for it, but I'm worried I'm too inexperienced. I have two years as a content manager under my belt, in addition to two years in a PR agency where I was also writing. I guess my question is for people who took on the role of \"first marketing hire\": When in your career did you make this move and how did you know you were ready? Open to advice from others as well.\"",

        "text": "Hi All!\n\nI have a question about returning to work after a big lifestyle change. I’ve been working in content marketing in some capacity for about a decade and then really found my groove with it in the last 5 years or so as I started taking on leadership roles as a Creative Director at a start-up, Senior Copywriter in big tech, then a Content Marketing Manager in mid-size tech for about a year.\n\nWell, I got pregnant and had a baby a year ago (yeah!) and made the decision to take a job that allowed for more flexibility in schedule and wasn’t as demanding as big tech. My current role is content marketing-adjacent. I develop training and education for other content marketers, editors, writers, etc., and I still do freelance content marketing.\n\nMy question (finally) is if I wanted to pursue content leadership roles again in the next year or two as my lifestyle shifts again, or if the content marketing itch is unbearable, and I want to return sooner, do you think I’ll have to “work my way up” to those content leadership roles I was tracking on before, so to speak? Like I’ll have some time to make up for? Do you think there are some industries that are better for working, first-time moms than others? I’m sure each company is different, but I’m curious if anyone has seen trends.\n\nThanks!",
