This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: mid (4-7 years of experience)\n\n\"Hello everyone, need your help &amp; inputs :pray:\n\nI have an opportunity to join an early-stage startup (employee #1 in marketing) with ~ 10 member team and ~ $1 Mn ARR. They have raised $1 Mn funding but do not want to raise any funds and want to grow sustainably.\n\nI have 5 years of experience in marketing with 1 year of experience in SaaS. I'm evaluating if I should accept this opportunity as it looks interesting to me, but I have some doubts:\n\n:point_right: They want to grow 5x in the next 3 years (mostly organic) but their product doesn't have relevant search queries. The growth so far has been via community, word of mouth, etc.\n- Is it possible to scale 5x with no paid marketing i.e via Referral, Community, etc? (else, I might risk my job due to performance issues).\n\nTheir ACV is ~$600 and they are in dev tools.\n\nAppreciate your valuable time and inputs :pray:\"",
