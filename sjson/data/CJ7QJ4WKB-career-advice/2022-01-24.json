But how to help content marketers succinctly describe their brands TOV remains an issue. :sweat:",

I've worked with multiple client's this way and it's helped me keep up with tight deadline.\n\nThough, what I realized is that, it's hard to build a unique brand identity when the brands voice is a duplicate of another brand. I realised that each brand is built differently, and while some might have similar  tone of voice, the mic dropping or thumb stopping difference is in tone of voice originality. But how to help content marketers succinctly describe their brands TOV remains an issue. "
