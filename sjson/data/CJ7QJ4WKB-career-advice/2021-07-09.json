Outputs might be: 1) Content that builds a brand\/executive's profile\/thought leadership; 2) Content that ranks well in search engine results; 3) Content that drives backlinks; 4) Content that goes viral and drives broad awareness.\n\nIn my experience hiring journalists to support content, the natural synergy undoubtedly begins with bullet #1. That said, if you go down this route a few things to consider: 1) A good story from a journalist perspective does not always equal a good marketing\/agency story; 2) Understanding detail\/nuance of language as Charles pointed out is critical—and being open to copy edits (and learning from them) is equally as important; 3) Finding a good agency partner is just as important—look for clients that understand exactly what they want from you (write the story, identify the narrative angle, etc.) and have open dialogues about concerns (e.g. set limits on revisions, have checkpoints along the writing development phase to ensure you don't deliver an off brand final product at the last stop).\n\nDepending on the role of content you're applying for, your skillsets will very.
