It'll be super tough, but I'm excited.\n\nI see a lot of freelance content strategists combining strategy with writing. I have hired so many incredible writers over the years, built great friendships and I respect the craft massively. However, for me personally, I don' feel as though writing is where my passion\/strengths lie. I enjoy content strategy, KWR, building content systems, CRO and managing teams of freelance writers.\n\nI've been reading old threads here, and some fantastic advice from <@U034FVBA14Y> and <@U01DMU97FSS>. And <@U0211K6LSM9> seems like you were in the exact position as I am now :slightly_smiling_face:.\n\n*My question is, do you think there is demand for freelance content strategists\/consultants\/managers who don't write?

I’m a graphic designer, lately from the newspaper industry, where I mainly did infographics and page design, with miscellaneous photo collages, advertising and other graphics assignments in addition. I am an expert with the Adobe Creative Suite, especially Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign and Acrobat, as well as Office 365. I am very good with photography. I have also written a couple feature articles and have researched and written the copy for some of my graphics.
