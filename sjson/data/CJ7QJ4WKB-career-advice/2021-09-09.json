This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: junior (1-3 years of experience)\n\n\"Hey folks, I have 3.5 years of experience in content marketing in B2B SaaS and I was recently promoted to the position of team lead. Is it too early? Should I consider going back to IC roles? \n\nI'm doing okay so far, but I do find that some parts of people management require more patience than I have (which is okay with me). And, as many of you have mentioned, leadership roles in content marketing are a mix of managing people + executing so I'm juggling both. \n\nAnd here's another thing to consider: I feel like I have a lot to learn when it comes to content marketing and there's a lot of room for improvement when it comes to my writing skills. So, I'm a bit confused about how this team lead role is going to impact my career. Suggestions?\"",
