One part of the trend is an increasing number of companies with Chief Content Officers. This started picking up about five years ago, with public companies starting to consider such roles, for example. I know, because a headhunting agency reached out and asked for input as they were drafting a white paper or such for clients who were asking whether they should be considering such a move. And if you search on LinkedIn, you'll see some folks with such titles.\n\nGiven the trend, I made sure I was getting compensated at the equivalent level relative to those folks. I didn't fight for the title, which would have been superfluous in my case, because I was already serving on our exec team at NerdWallet and I reported to our CEO. I wouldn't have gained anything but a title, which to me, meh. (This varies with individuals, of course.)\n\nSomething to consider when shooting for titles — they often mean relatively little once you've achieved enough. At least some people think that — as long as your scope and comp are where you want them, that's most important, IMO.\n\nAnd being say a VP means different things at different sized companies — it's really about what scope and what size of team(s) and resources you have oversight over that matter when it comes to roles.\n\nFWIW, I've been recruited for C-level and VP of marketing roles. There's no consistency in what that means. Personally, though, I'm not interested in becoming head of marketing, whatever the title, because I wanna focus on content. That might have been different had this not been my second career.\n\nWith the cost and time of MBAs, it's worth consider the opportunity cost you'd pay. If you talk to some people with master’s they didn't get enough ROI. Of course, everyone is different.\n\nFunny thing: I've actually mentored MBAs, including several from Harvard. I worked with many of them at NerdWallet, because we hired many BizOps people from Bain and such years ago. I ended up with three MBAs assigned to partner with my function in BizOps roles at one point, plus several MBAs whom I'd hired as editors. Among the latter, there was no difference in work performance compared with peers without MBAs and I didn't pay them anything more — businesses with common sense should pay for results, not credentials, unless the credential accrues to the bottom line directly or indirectly, IMO (because if you have the skills and they show up in your work, why does it matter how you learned them?).\n\nI'm still close to the three Harvard MBAs I've mentored. But I've worked with and overlapped with so many people with educational pedigrees and such that I realized that the talented ones would've succeeded no matter what; the degree wasn't the differentiator.\n\nI've also worked with a number of people with great resumes or credentials who were turkeys. Like I've been asked for guidance from MBAs who clearly learned little about business, because their questions were so basic I couldn't believe they were asking. LOL.\n\nWorth mentioning, given your age: The trend among even major companies is to increasingly move away from requiring degrees. Instead, the secular trend will be more lifelong learning of various sorts, like online classes and programs. How that will affect top jobs at various types of companies is yet to unfold. ",

I worked in higher ed comms for a few years and that's the only time it has ever come up (they tend to like degrees in academia).\n\nBut I'll agree with <@U02VBUQR0E7>. It hasn't been an issue at all in recent hiring processes or chats with recruiters. The smart companies (the ones you want to work for!) are de-emphasizing higher education in lieu of experience.\n\nNow, if you WANT to learn more about the business-end of markcomm or want to aim for a CMO title, it might be useful. What roles do you want in the next few years? What experience do you need? Think about where your resume is lighter and either take on responsibilities that address it or supplement with education. I would try to work for a company that would pay for some of it though. Degrees aren't cheap!",
