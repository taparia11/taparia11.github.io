But I'm also starting up the content marketing program (with a small team of freelancers!) because I have experience with that and we need to be focusing on top-of-funnel. I don't touch paid ads (except to have a sense of what we're doing); we're also in the process of hiring a Growth Lead.\n\nFor more great insights on this, I'm going to point to another MKT1 article about the fuel and the engine â€” such a good metaphor for how content\/product\/growth marketing work together: "
