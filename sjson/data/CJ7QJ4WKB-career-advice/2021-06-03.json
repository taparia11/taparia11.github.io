My current role is “Content and Managing Editor” though I am pretty much the only person running content strategy and overall content marketing at my company. I told my manager that my ultimate goal is “Director of Global Content” to which we both agreed I didn’t quite have the career experience for yet at this point (only about 4 years in content marketing). However, she agreed on a title bump in the meantime — but with content being such a nebulous area I’m not even sure what that title would be. Does anyone have any advice on what I should ask for if my ultimate goal is Director of Content? Any resources you may have would be helpful as well, like IDPs you may have used while taking the same steps? Thanks a bunch in advance!",
