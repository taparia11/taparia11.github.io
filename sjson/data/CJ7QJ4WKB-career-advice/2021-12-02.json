This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: junior (1-3 years of experience)\n\n\"What has been your experience with job searching for content roles in terms of 1) length of search (ex. x months, etc), 2) most common and\/or successful method of getting interviews (ex. cold applying, getting referred by someone you know, etc), and 3) number of applications sent out (and to be even more specific, applications sent out: interviews received ratio)?\n\nI've been searching and interviewing for content marketing roles for a while and I know I'm being pretty selective (and with that understand my search may take a while) but can't help but sometimes feel like I'm doing something wrong. Would appreciate hearing about different peoples' content marketing job search journeys! Thanks so much.\"",

For example, if you have a health client, the article links may be separated out into subtopics like senior health, health technology, or even insurance. Then, I would create categories on your site that you can refer potential clients to based on their interests. You may have the same article in several categories, but since the potential client is looking for something specific, this shows you can cover their niche. If you use social media, be sure to have keywords for the topics you know well in there, too. Many of my jobs over the years have come from search of my keywords.

I say this because it's often really hard to tell what a content job is about until the interview phase.

For example, are you getting replies or even interviews but are beat out by other candidates? Are you getting any feedback to why you aren't getting jobs? Have you considered broadening your search and making the decision whether to move forward later in the process? I say this because it's often really hard to tell what a content job is about until the interview phase. I might have ruled out a few opportunities based on the listing alone, but found out later through interviews that it would actually be something I would enjoy."
