I’m proud of it, but it no longer reflects the work I want, which is content strategy and management work. I’m way more passionate about managing teams and developing strategy now than I am writing (though I don’t mind writing from time to time, it’s just not want I want to spend my whole day doing. And frankly, I’m way more confident in my people management, process building, and strategy development. \n\nWhat kinds of work examples can I showcase on my site to market my skills? The first thing that comes to mind is case study style content. Should I share metrics like number of content pieces my team has developed, traffic stats, campaign results etc? Imposter syndrome is creeping in and I feel like the results from my past work as a strategist and manager won’t sound impressive to a prospective client. Maybe it’s a problem of not knowing how to communicate and contextualize my accomplishments. \n\nI appreciate any advice in advance! I’m feeling a little vulnerable and unsure of myself today. ",
