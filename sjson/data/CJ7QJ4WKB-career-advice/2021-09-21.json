One thing that was a great way to grow into this space is working with project managers or CX\/CS people in your org and asking what problems they're facing every day.

Finding out what those are and offering solutions will give you a great foot into the door of content strategy work",

One thing that was a great way to grow into this space is working with project managers or CX\/CS people in your org and asking what problems they're facing every day. Are there opportunities content can help lighten the load? This isn't directly associated with strategy, but often content can serve larger business purposes than demand and lead gen. Finding out what those are and offering solutions will give you a great foot into the door of content strategy work"

They don’t (usually) care if it’s a podcast, a book, or a blog post → these are _tactics_. What they expect to hear is how the content we produce will solve a business challenge → this is _strategy_. So a writer makes themselves immensely more valuable and employable when they move from ‘just’ delivering like a tactician to also thinking like a strategist.\n\nHere’s my practical advice for a writer who wants to do this:\n\n*1. Start from a DIAGNOSIS phase*. Before jumping into offering solutions, understand what’s going on. A few questions to explore:\n- _What’s the business challenge we’re trying to overcome?_\n_- Who is the target audience?_\n_- What content resonates the most with them?_\n_- How is existing content, if any, working for this target?_\n_- When people search for [topic] in Google, what do they expect to see?_\n_- Who else is competing with us?_\n\n2. Once you have a sense of where things are, *continue with a STRATEGY phase*. This is where you define your objectives &amp; where you want to go. A few questions for this step:\n- _When do we want to see results?_\n_- How will we measure them?_\n_- How will we position content for this audience?_\n_- What overall themes\/topics will we use to engage them?_\n_- What will we cover? In how much depth?_\n\n3. At this point, you can finally *focus on the specific TACTICS* you will use to carry out the strategy and deliver its results. A few questions here:\n- _Which channel(s) do we focus on?_\n_- What content format(s) do we need?_\n_- What assets should we invest in?_\n_- How frequently do we publish?_",
