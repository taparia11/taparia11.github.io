At the start of the pandemic, one of my clients was hiring for an internal marketing coordinator role, and I ended up working with them for a year and eight months. Most of that time, I was also freelancing on the side, though. It was a lot of work, but it allowed for a more successful transition once I was ready to go out on my own again. There are perks to both. Freelancing gives you freedom, and being in-house typically gives you stability and good benefits. I'll probably go back to 9-5 at some point, but for now, I am excited to be freelancing.",

At the start of the pandemic, one of my clients was hiring for an internal marketing coordinator role, and I ended up working with them for a year and eight months. Most of that time, I was also freelancing on the side, though. It was a lot of work, but it allowed for a more successful transition once I was ready to go out on my own again. There are perks to both. Freelancing gives you freedom, and being in-house typically gives you stability and good benefits. I'll probably go back to 9-5 at some point, but for now, I am excited to be freelancing."
