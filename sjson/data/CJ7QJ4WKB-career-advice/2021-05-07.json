Also, would any one be willing to provide feedback on my resume \/cv once I create it? \n\nThank you. \n\n\"",

This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: junior (1-3 years of experience)\n\n\"Hi everyone,\n\nThe recent Superpath survey on test projects got me curious about:\n1) how\/if people have been able to negotiate pay or set more expectations around an interviewing test project and \n2) if anyone has ever declined moving forward with a test project because they felt the conditions were unfair (ex. work could be used by company, too arduous of a task for little or no compensation, etc)? \n\nAs I am more junior in my career, I don't have the confidence that if I negotiate pay\/more expectations, etc. that would yield positive results (when I have tried I've had mixed results, and have been burned anyways). Also, I feel so fortunate to receive interview offers that it's difficult to push back on the initial task outlined by the company (also being junior I wonder if I'm out of line with seeking compensation, asking for a shorter assignment, etc). \n\nThank you so much for your time! \"",
