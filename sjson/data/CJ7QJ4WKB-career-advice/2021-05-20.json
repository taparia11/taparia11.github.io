This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: mid (4-7 years of experience)\n\n\"I work at a start-up that's preparing to raise a series B. According to the plan, within one year of a successful raise, we will go from about 80 employees to more than 200. This headcount is desperately needed, but that's a LOT of hiring in a short period of time, and I imagine my own role (and seniority level) will also change drastically as a result. For example, I currently project manage, strategize, AND execute copy for an entire strategic piece of the business, and I could really use a team. Any advice to help me start thinking about, planning, and preparing for something like this?\"",
