This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: mid (4-7 years of experience)\n\n\"Hello everyone! I'm at the point in my career where I am analyzing whether or not I want to stay in independent contributor roles, or move into the people management realm. Annual reviews are coming up and my manager wants to discuss which route I'd like to take.\n\nI love team collaboration and I've always valued myself for being one of the \"leading from the back\" types of people (i.e. stepping up and taking on responsibilities\/overflow work, running trainings, etc.), so early in my career I set my sights on people management. But during the pandemic I was an interim director at an agency and had a bad experience. It's not clear to me whether the experience was negative due to the circumstances (agency life, lack of training, bad manager and pandemic problems) or due to my dislike of people management. I ended up leaving that management role to go back to being an IC in-house, but now my manager is encouraging me to think about people management again.\n\nSo my question is: How did you decide whether to stay IC or move into people management?  How did you know you were ready to start managing people?\"",

But if you have a solid understanding of the work your team is doing and what's involved, it gives you a leg to stand on while you work on your leadership skills.\n2. In my marketing leadership experience, most people management role still involve a ton of _doing_ (e.g. strategy and editing). So it's a bit of a false dichotomy to say it's either\/or.\n3. At 4-7 years into your career, you should still be in the exploration phase until you find what you love doing. I would personally jump at the opportunity to do something new (i.e. the leadership role). It will also be harder to get a first-time leadership role at a new company vs. one you're already in.\nHope that helps!",
