You'll want someone you feel quite comfy with. I dunno how else you can really find that fit without doing initial meetups\/interviews! And in today's day n age, in-person vs remote coaching can be a huge variable too. Even if a coach comes highly recommended, if they can't do in-person and that's what you really need... well, then it's not a good fit :)",

I can send you a link to her site if you're interested.\n\nTips wise, I think a lot of it comes down to finding personality fit. If you're going to be working 1:1 with someone for a while, and getting into personalized (and personal!) stuff... it's probably going to get intense, and emotional too. You'll want someone you feel quite comfy with. I dunno how else you can really find that fit without doing initial meetups\/interviews! And in today's day n age, in-person vs remote coaching can be a huge variable too. Even if a coach comes highly recommended, if they can't do in-person and that's what you really need... well, then it's not a good fit :)"

This is such an important discussion.\n\nI had a very similar situation and I struggled to find the right coach, I interviewed many, and at the end of the day not a single one of them had done more than one thing on my list of goals.\n(write a book, scale my team, scale my processes, make earnings publicly speaking etc.) I loved my time with the coach I eventually chose, but if I had to do it again I would have kept looking. I guess what I’m saying is I have NO idea how to find the right fit. Good luck and keep me posted - I will want a coach again, it’s something I try to do yearly at least for part of the year (because it also costs so much). Next time I really want to find out that can help me with more advanced PM, scaling, process building, and who has the connections to help me make some strides in a few areas. Again, my coach was lovely and I liked her a lot, it just wasn’t quite right and looking at her curriculum\/plans I should have known that.\n\nSince you mentioned the going rate, I don’t mind sharing what I paid. My last one cost me 5k for 90 days. :money_mouth_face: :grimacing:",

This is such an important discussion.\n\nI had a very similar situation and I struggled to find the right coach, I interviewed many, and at the end of the day not a single one of them had done more than one thing on my list of goals.\n(write a book, scale my team, scale my processes, make earnings publicly speaking etc.) I loved my time with the coach I eventually chose, but if I had to do it again I would have kept looking. I guess what I’m saying is I have NO idea how to find the right fit. Good luck and keep me posted - I will want a coach again, it’s something I try to do yearly at least for part of the year (because it also costs so much). Next time I really want to find out that can help me with more advanced PM, scaling, process building, and who has the connections to help me make some strides in a few areas. Again, my coach was lovely and I liked her a lot, it just wasn’t quite right and looking at her curriculum\/plans I should have known that.\n\nSince you mentioned the going rate, I don’t mind sharing what I paid. My last one cost me 5k for 90 days. "
