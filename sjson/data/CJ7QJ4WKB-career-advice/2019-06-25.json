I told her I'd get back to her and am just looking for reasonable compensation. The more I ask around, the more I'm starting to see that an hourly rate might not be ideal for me. She positioned it as ideal, but it's starting to look like what she meant is that an hourly rate compensation is ideal for _her_.\n\nThe job is a good fit, so I think she's open to negotiate, so my question for folks with experience is: how do you position project based rates to clients best for buy-in?",
