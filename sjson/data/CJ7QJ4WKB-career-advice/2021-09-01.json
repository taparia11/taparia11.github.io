Are you doing 1.5 people's jobs? Try to express your workload terms of things like 'full time equivalent' etc. Then, if you can reasonably predict that you'll keep or grow that level of tasking in the next year, you've added a prong to your business case.\n\nResearch the market rate for your basket of responsibilities, in your industry. If you're working as 1.30x a project manager  and 0.50x a content strategist, you could math that out and find the delta between your salary now vs desired.\n\nBonus points if you can lay out career pathing. In 3 years, you expect to be at 3x the level of responsibility, so there's a target salary you can work towards, and you can negotiate for an interim figure between what you earn now and that.\n\nIf the CEO is a big picture person (many are), a short, crisp, to the point argument is probably going to land better than an exhaustive analysis of every responsibility you have. But I've no idea of your context, so maybe this particular meeting needs to be in depth.\n\nGenerally though, make a business case vs any vague appeal to subjective ideals (\"i worked without a manager, that shows I'm great, pay me more!\" = no good).\n\n&lt;\/2 cents&gt;",

Are you doing 1.5 people's jobs? Try to express your workload terms of things like 'full time equivalent' etc. Then, if you can reasonably predict that you'll keep or grow that level of tasking in the next year, you've added a prong to your business case.\n\nResearch the market rate for your basket of responsibilities, in your industry. If you're working as 1.30x a project manager  and 0.50x a content strategist, you could math that out and find the delta between your salary now vs desired.\n\nBonus points if you can lay out career pathing. In 3 years, you expect to be at 3x the level of responsibility, so there's a target salary you can work towards, and you can negotiate for an interim figure between what you earn now and that.\n\nIf the CEO is a big picture person (many are), a short, crisp, to the point argument is probably going to land better than an exhaustive analysis of every responsibility you have. But I've no idea of your context, so maybe this particular meeting needs to be in depth.\n\nGenerally though, make a business case vs any vague appeal to subjective ideals (\"i worked without a manager, that shows I'm great, pay me more!\" = no good).\n\n<\/2 cents>"
