By the time I was done I had worked through 40 1:1s out of a 180 person company, many of whom were repeat suggestions. Now, that's a little intense you don't have to do 40 meetings but that approach:\n• introduced me to all the top experts and power structures in the company\n• gave me a view of operations from several different perspectives\n• highlighted ideas\/resources from other teams that have improved my marketing efforts \n• and provided me a substantial content wishlist prioritized by how many people asked for each piece of content (I asked everyone for their top three content wishes but made no promises)\nI've also noticed the people I met with initially get back to me quicker and are more helpful than the people I didn't. \n\n+1 on quick wins as well, so so important.
