I'm a journalist based in Toronto who recently transitioned to content creation. I'm slowly building a freelance content creation portfolio, and I feel confident in my ability to write and deliver clear, clean and comprehensive content on a broad range of topics, but I feel lost when I start to dive a bit deeper into the full spectrum of content work. I don't have experience, for example, in creating lead generation tools like whitepapers, sales funnels, or even social media strategy.\n\nMy questions are: (a) Are these absolutely necessary skills to learn? and (b) Can they be picked up on the job or did you seek out a certificate program? Also, unrelated (c): Is it worth spending a lot of time looking for new clients right now?\n\nThanks for your time. For reference, the bulk of my experience is in food and beverage (my goal is coordinating content for D2C tools and products) and skincare and wellness. Happy to be here. Thankful for any insight you have to share with me.",
