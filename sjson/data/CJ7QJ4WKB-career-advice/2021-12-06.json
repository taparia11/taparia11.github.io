This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: junior (1-3 years of experience)\n\n\"Hi everyone, I have a question about self-education in content marketing to advance my career.\n\nI feel like I've been a bit stuck in my career lately, and it makes me very frustrated. I've landed a senior content writer job that sounded promising, but after a while, it turned out not to be particularly challenging. Since I don't really have any \"mentor\" now - nor a promising career path in my current workplace - I want to try and educate myself a bit more before I look for a new job. My goal is to move on to a more strategy-oriented position eventually. However, I feel stuck in an \"I'm not experienced enough to land a strategy-oriented job, but my current duties are not strategy-oriented enough to let me gain that experience\" sort of vicious circle.\n\nI know nothing can replace hands-on experience, but what kind of course\/books\/resources\/ do you think are good stepping stones to career advancement? I'm looking to assemble a sort of content marketing curriculum for myself. I'm primarily interested in content strategy building and SEO, but I'll welcome all recommendations. \n\nI'd really appreciate your help!\"",
