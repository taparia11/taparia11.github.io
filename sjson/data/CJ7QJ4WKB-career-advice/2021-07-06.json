On top of the traditional reporting\/editing duties, I also help develop and create sponsored content and help edit\/produce the publication’s two podcasts. I actually setup the company’s podcast network. Before my current company I also worked for the national public broadcaster (CBC) as a reporter, web writer and producer. My experience is pretty diverse. \n\nAs you probably know, a journalist’s skillset transfers very well for these types of jobs. I’ve been getting interviews and have gotten pretty far along in the process in some of them, but ultimately they are looking with someone with more “experience” in that space, or something along those lines. But in most cases, they’ve instead asked if they could reach out to me for freelance work though, so I don’t think I’m completely missing the mark at least haha!\n\nI absolutely plan on taking on Freelance work and building up my “content creator” portfolio more. But I was wondering if anyone has any other advice for how someone with my background could better position myself for these types of roles? \n\nIf you’re a former journalist, how did you go about making this switch? If you’re a company that hires these types of roles, what would you want to see from someone with my kind of resume? Etc.\n:pray:\nThank you so much! @",
