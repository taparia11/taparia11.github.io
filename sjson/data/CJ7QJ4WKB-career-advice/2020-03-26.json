Two weeks ago, someone reached out to me via my website, my manifesto (which <@UJJFDTN8G> helped with, thanks!) had really resonated with them, and they wanted me to do some freelance writing for them.\n\nAfter talking to them, it was clear we were a good fit, and the project was right up my alley.\n\nThey hired me, we created amazing work and lived happily ever after? Not quite.\nThey did hire me, our second meeting also went great, but after completing a task they'd given me, I heard back from them saying that even though they really liked my website and I seemed like a great person, this wouldn't be a fit and it would be better if we didn't work together.\n\nI fully respect their decision, but I can't get over how much they must've hated what I sent for them to completely switch gears. I was also working on another task for them, and I'm now debating whether it's worth it to finish that and send it to them?\n\nI feel very lucky to work FT in such difficult times and to have the privilege to feel sad about losing freelance work. I already came up with quite a few things I should've done differently in my work, but any tips on getting over losing a project that seemed perfect would be greatly appreciated.",

When you delivered the first piece to them, what did they specifically say about it? Personally if I'm working with a freelancer, I iron out any kinks with them in a very straightforward manner. It would have to be an extraordinary circumstance for me to decide the work is unsalvageable - so much so that it's not happened to me yet.\n2. RE the second task - don't debate this internally. You may be contractually obliged - I don't know your situation. If you're not, and you haven't got any kind of advance payment from them, it seems like they shouldn't want any more work from you, but I'd just ask them very clearly. I'd try seeking further feedback on your first piece first - seems fishy that they've just dropped your work with no explanation. \n3. As for getting over losing a project? Unfortunately that's just going to suck. I'm really sorry about that. But if you do your best to earnestly learn exactly why this went wrong, and fix that in future, that's the best you can do! Honestly, I'd highly recommend having a face to face (or video, if that's not possible) chat with this person and firmly, but politely, question them for the full details here.\nIt's hard to accurately answer this without knowing more details, but I hope the above is a good starting point for you. I'm sure some other more experienced people than me can chime in here with some wisdom too!\n\nBest of luck going forward. Don't let this get you down - learn all you can, then move on and focus on your next work. That's what really matters. :slightly_smiling_face:",
