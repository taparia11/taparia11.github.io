The occasions largely fall into two categories:\n1-I’m scared and think a new gig will be better\/safer\/scratch an itch\/be easier\/any other lie that fear drives you to believe.\n(Fear of failure and fear of success are very similar in my experience.)\n2-The current situation is untenable.\nWhether that’s a terrible culture\/hierarchy;\nor it’s not a bad _place_, it’s just a bad _fit_;\nor I am having semi-regular panic attacks.\n(Sadly, there are many examples of this category listed above.)\n\nIf it’s the first, address the source of the fear. Battle it. Take it out back and end its miserable existence. It’s a process--a sometimes excruciating one--but worthwhile. Afterwards, survey the grasses. Is yours greener now?\nIf it’s the second, update your résumé.\n(Overhaul it if you need to.)\nPut together your book\/portfolio.\nLook at your best work.\nLook at your favorite work.\n(Maybe there’s overlap, maybe not.) Analyze it. Why are you proud? What do yo love about it? What are the commonalities you didn’t see before? This process always reminds me of my value and my interests and my strengths. Dig deep and poke around.\n\nNow you’ve got your personal value prop, a great looking CV, a confidence boost, and clarity about what you want.\n\nTake all that information and lay it down on the table next to your current job.\nDoes it match up?\nYes? :arrow_right: You’re probably in a good spot; just needed some objectivity. Keep working hard and reassess down the road.\nNo? :arrow_heading_down:\nCould you and the leadership reshape it to match up?\nYes? :arrow_right: Rock n’ Roll! Stay  and build something new and exciting. It could benefit you and the whole org.\nNo? :arrow_heading_down:\n      Bounce.\nFind something that can stand up and take the heat from this newly-stoked fire of confidence and vision.\n\nIn short,\n1. Search your soul.\n2. Listen carefully to your honest self.\n3. Objectively analyze and synthesize your work and your strengths.\n4. Don’t sell yourself short. \n(Simple, right? :wink:)",
