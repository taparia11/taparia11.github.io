This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: senior (8+ years)\n\n\"I'd love any tips from fellow Superpathers on how to provide constructive feedback to management on colleagues without making it personal or seemingly petty.\n\nBackground: We have a contractor who has been with us for several months and is increasingly steamrolling projects and lowering our close-knit team's morale with poor management skills (condescending tone, poor active listening, interrupting us during meetings, etc.).\n\nMany of these interactions and events transpired while our team's manager was out on paternal leave. He's returned, and there are murmurs this contractor (who was supposed to leave at the end of Q3) may stay on our team for Q4, possibly as a full-time employee. *Many* colleagues and I have immense concerns about this, but we don't think our manager knows about just how debilitating this contractor's personality, work ethic, and communication skills have been. Upper management has only had good things to say about this contractor, although they are also not privy to the crummy treatment the rest of us get, or the additional work that gets piled onto our plates as a result.\n\nI have a strong rapport with my manager and I feel comfortable going to him with these concerns, but I want to make sure the feedback on this contractor is objective and constructive. It is challenging to provide \"facts\" when so much of why this contractor is a poor addition to the team is in personal interactions and how we're treated. I would love any recommendations on how to reposition seemingly \"personal\" complaints into objective, task-oriented feedback.\"",
