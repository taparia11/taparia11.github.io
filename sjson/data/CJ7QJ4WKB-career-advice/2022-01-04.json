This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: junior (1-3 years of experience)\n\n\"Hi everyone. I'm a freelance SEO content writer, been at this for over a year now. The issue now is that I realized I've been focusing on B2C content, but my heart right now is on B2B content. I've checked out works in that niche and I know I can pull it off plus it will suit my career journey.\n\nSo for B2B writers seeing this, freelancing or not, what kind of samples or paid work did you do that helped you get in? Jobs I've been seeing always ask for experience or like 3 B2B writing samples. So I'm confused on the kind of writing piece to create to pitch to clients if I'm not working under a B2B company or an agency.\n\nFor marketing execs or those that work with B2B writers, what kind of samples do you look out for? Is there a chance that writers without B2B Samples can be hired with samples from other niches or cos they show enthusiasm and potential in their work?\"",
