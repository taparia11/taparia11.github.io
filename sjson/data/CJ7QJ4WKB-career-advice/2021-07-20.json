Sounds super disappointing. here's my read on this...\n• First, it is almost always a bad idea as a manager to promise a promotion to anyone because there are always things in the business that can change. It is fair to say \"I am advocating for this promotion for you.\" but unless your manager is the CEO...their promise may not hold an enormous amount of water. It sounds like your manager made a mistake here.  \n• Second, this means that sometimes we need to do far more work to ensure a promotion than feels entirely fair. That usually looks like -- documenting it. This is good practice for anyone at all times, to make sure manager and employee have agreed on what it will look like to be ready for the next step, and that agreement should include dependencies beyond your control (ex: I've had people want to move into people management, but the team wasn't big enough to need that role. It doesn't matter how good that person gets, that particular promotion path was not an option for them)\n• Third, while not a red flag, your feelings are 100% and completely valid! And you should talk to your manager about this. The Situation, Behavior, Impact framework is my go-to for situations like this. \"Hey, I was expecting a promotion &amp; raise as we've discussing, and that didn't happen. As you might imagine, I'm feeling pretty disappointed and a bit undervalued. I'm also wondering if I can trust that this will actually materialize in January. Can you help me better understand what happened here?\" It was likely beyond your manager's control, but you still deserve to be heard on this. \n• Fourth, do NOT just hope for the best in January. Do your best to gently and kindly get your promotion plan documented and an agreement from your manager that this is actually happening for you. ",

I think the centralized content team is a newer concept, so it seems like there's a lot of opportunity to pick and choose where you go\/how you grow if you're with the right organization that values content! I've seen positions like \"VP of Content and Community\" and head of \"brand and content\" at different organizations across tech. For me personally, I started in content, was the Head of Content at a global SaaS and then went to the Director of Marketing at a start-up, where I've grown to VP. I think what's great about being a content marketer is that you have to understand and digest to many parts of marketing - demand, brand, product, customer, partner, etc. - so you have a lot of flexibility in how you grow depending on what you like best.",

I think the centralized content team is a newer concept, so it seems like there's a lot of opportunity to pick and choose where you go\/how you grow if you're with the right organization that values content! I've seen positions like \"VP of Content and Community\" and head of \"brand and content\" at different organizations across tech. For me personally, I started in content, was the Head of Content at a global SaaS and then went to the Director of Marketing at a start-up, where I've grown to VP. I think what's great about being a content marketer is that you have to understand and digest to many parts of marketing - demand, brand, product, customer, partner, etc. - so you have a lot of flexibility in how you grow depending on what you like best."
