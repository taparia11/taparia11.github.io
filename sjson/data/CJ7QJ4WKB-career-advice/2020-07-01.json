They wouldn't still be speaking with you if you weren't an excellent candidate.\n\nSpeaking of wasting time, I would say have those frank conversations and make sure the potential role isn't wasting YOUR time.

I've been in a similar predicament to yours (the start-up world can make you feel on top of the world...and also make you questions everything haha), and while it was really hard to remind myself, and I had to ask a professional mentor to help remind me, the interview process is as much for you as it is for them. You'll probably not have another chance to ask candid questions without much to lose. So don't be afraid to ask things like, \"You said the original candidate that declined had more experience. Do you see that additional experience being a major obstacle for me to overcome?\" Or even, \"I've seen this job has been posted a couple more times.
