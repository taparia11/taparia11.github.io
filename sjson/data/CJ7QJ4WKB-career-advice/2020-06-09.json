In doing so, I've learned a ton about the ins and outs of digital marketing, and I think that knowledge is an asset anywhere. But I'm struggling to get any traction when applying to content or writing roles in industries I have more personal interest in (entertainment, beauty, social entrepreneurship), I feel like my lack of professional experience in those industries is a deal breaker, even if I have a ton of knowledge on them acquired from sheer personal interest.
