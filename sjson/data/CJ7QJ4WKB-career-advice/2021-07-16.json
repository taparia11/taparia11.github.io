I understand that my career just started like yesterday, but I want to transition to content marketing. However, companies won't hire me because \"you don't have the necessary experience to work in this capacity\". I'm confused as to how I'm going to get experience with content marketing if no one will even hire me in a entry-level content marketing role?\n\nHas anyone experienced this before? Please help me out. And if you do have or know of a company in need of writers, I'd really appreciate it if you let me know. \n\nThank you!",
