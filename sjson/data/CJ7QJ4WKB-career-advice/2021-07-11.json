One thing that stands out to me immediately is that you're talking about largely about inputs \"pitch\" \"assist\" \"curate\" \"tasked with\" vs outputs \"added X followers\" \"published X articles that generated X views\". If this is a pattern that is following through to your interviews then the impact is likely that interviewers feel confident that you can do the work (evidence: freelance offers) but less confidence that you can drive results for the business (evidence: no job offers).\n\nIt might be worth your time to engage a resume writer or coach who can help you think about how to position yourself and your work. The fact that you're getting interviews means you have a compelling resume and story. You're really close! Might just need to sharpen how you sell your story.",
