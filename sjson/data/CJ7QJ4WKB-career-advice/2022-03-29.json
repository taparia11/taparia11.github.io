A handful through LinkedIn. And, once in a while, a client or two through cold emails.\n\nHowever, my cold emails are never generic, and I never send them to random companies. I always make sure that I have some kind of connection to them, which makes it more \"lukewarm\" than cold (haha).\n\nWhat's worked for me is really putting the work into figuring out my target client and focusing on them. I have a long list of what I'm looking for in a client and contract, so I only spend time pursuing those who fit the bill.

Yes a quick read is helpful however, a recruiter is going to be be looking for very specific details that align to what is listed exactly in the JD.\n\nAre you tailoring your resume for each position?\n\nMy suggestions are\n\n• taking out the line “my day to day responsibilities” (it's clear the bullet points are your responsibilities)\n• however — update bullet points to focus on achievements instead responsibilities using the X,y.z formula: I did x, through y, and the impact was z. Use it to tell a very short and consists story \n• Try and use the exact wording from the JD in your resume\/bullet points. (in case they run your resume through an ATS system where the scan for key words)\n• list out key competencies (hard and soft skills) in a section of its own. Bullet points should be your achievements and it will be easier to see your skills separately \n\n",

So many resumes I've looked at only talk about what someone did, not how well they did it.\n\nAnd going back to a mention further up in the thread, a cover letter will help set you apart too. Especially if it's optional. It shows an additional level of investment and complements the resume in a way that gives a snapshot of your personality. Based on the cover letters I've reviewed, one suggestion to really help yours stand out is tell a story with it. Telling me you're good at this or you have that skill doesn't actually tell me anything. Share an example, weave a short story. Help the recruiter\/hiring manager see the value you can bring in tangible ways.\n\nJust some thoughts based on what I've seen going through this from the manager's side. Hope that helps! Feel free to DM me if you have any questions.",

So many resumes I've looked at only talk about what someone did, not how well they did it.\n\nAnd going back to a mention further up in the thread, a cover letter will help set you apart too. Especially if it's optional. It shows an additional level of investment and complements the resume in a way that gives a snapshot of your personality. Based on the cover letters I've reviewed, one suggestion to really help yours stand out is tell a story with it. Telling me you're good at this or you have that skill doesn't actually tell me anything. Share an example, weave a short story. Help the recruiter\/hiring manager see the value you can bring in tangible ways.\n\nJust some thoughts based on what I've seen going through this from the manager's side. Hope that helps! Feel free to DM me if you have any questions."

I think my sweet spot is somewhere in the middle, so it depends a lot on how a company defines each role.\n\nI'm drawn to product marketing because I love the higher-level strategic thinking: understanding the market, the competition, a company's value propositions, and how to do positioning well. I don't love the sitting-in-lots-of-meetings part, but I suppose that's how you \"get alignment.\"\n\nI'm drawn to content marketing because I love building and executing things: writing, editing, promoting, and listening. I don't love the lower salaries for this role or what feels like a marketing movement from value-driven storytelling into SEO gamification, but I suppose that's the way the :cookie: crumbles.\n\nAre you considering a transition? What do you see as the pros + cons?",
