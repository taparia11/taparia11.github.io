This particular employee has a “bad relationship with accountability” according to another manager who’s experienced similar time-scoping struggles with this employee. So it’s not a brand new issue. It’s just new to me, and I can only give her so much leeway.\n\n&gt;  let’s break it into three sub-tasks\nThis is something we’re definitely doing (glad to see this suggestion, it validates that I have a good idea, ha). We use Clickup for our project mgmt, and giving her clear time estimates for certain subtasks will help her be more accountable, I predict, and give us more visibility into where her hours ago.",

I have made it really clear that the deadline is X, so you need to send me what you have by X; I’d prefer you send me an 80% complete piece and tell me what else you wanted to do with it, than send me nothing. (This was with someone who had very high work quality when done, but was missing deadlines.) That mindset shift helped a lot but the “bad relationship with accountability” piece…that is a doozy. Honestly, having clear expectation convos--based on your OKR framework once you have that!--will be helpful in case this is an ongoing issue and you need to coach this person out. Sorry I can’t help more on the OKR side; I’m familiar but have never used them myself."
