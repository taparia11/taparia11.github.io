        "text": "Hi <@U01NY1HUTA7>! That’s exciting that you’re considering expanding your content journey :slightly_smiling_face: New beginnings are the sweet stuff of life.\n\nI guess I would challenge you to consider a couple of things:\n• What do you like about what you’re doing? Do you like working with content teams? Digital teams? Do you like the research?  \n• What don’t you like? You say you don’t like writing, but is it specific writing? Is it parts of the process?\n• What are you good at? It’s not uncommon for the things you like and the things you’re good at to coincide, but it’s not always the case! And if you happen to be good at things you don’t love doing, there’s still probably a way to leverage that in your resume\/portfolio. \nI’ve known a couple of people who started in SEO, and they’ve had different journeys. Here are a couple of career paths of a couple of my former colleagues:\n\nSEO Specialist &gt; Content Strategist &gt; Marketing Manager &gt; Brand Manager\n\nSEO Specialist &gt; Copywriter &gt; Content Marketing Manager &gt; Director of Communications &amp; Content\n\nIf you’d like more information or want to bounce off more ideas, I’m always up for a call\/Zoom meeting.",
