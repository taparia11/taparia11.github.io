I let a few clients know I wanted to transition to a full-time role by asking for references, and got a competing offer from an existing client.  It’s a big challenge transitioning from creator\/contributor to my new role of Content Marketing Manager.  (Wound up in a management job in tech that I never even applied or interviewed for!) There are a lot of gaps that pop up when you fulfil a strategy vs. creating the strategy; for me, many of those gaps lie in creating processes more than technical or creative know-how. I think what worked for me initially when job hunting was providing additionally strategic insight\/input into the content I produced, which let clients know I could do more than produce. I still have gaps to fill, and I’m going to do an MSc in Digital Marketing (a good option for me but not necessarily for everyone) that’s really well built for my particular skill gap and schedule.",
