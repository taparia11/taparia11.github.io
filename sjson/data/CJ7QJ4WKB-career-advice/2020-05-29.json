It revolved around building out your own marketing efforts through thought leadership, being a connector in the industry, etc. Definitely some good ideas there. We've recently discovered the power of professional mastermind groups and courses for getting access to job listings\/networking, etc. (After resisting the idea for years lol)\n\nI would also add: Referrals are golden. If you can find teams that are super connected (or positioned as marketplaces\/third parties) often they will be a great source of referrals as you do great work for them. Otherwise, the LinkedIn search bar has been really helpful to us, as well as niche online groups where our ideal clients hang out.",

It revolved around building out your own marketing efforts through thought leadership, being a connector in the industry, etc. Definitely some good ideas there. We've recently discovered the power of professional mastermind groups and courses for getting access to job listings\/networking, etc. (After resisting the idea for years lol)\n\nI would also add: Referrals are golden. If you can find teams that are super connected (or positioned as marketplaces\/third parties) often they will be a great source of referrals as you do great work for them. Otherwise, the LinkedIn search bar has been really helpful to us, as well as niche online groups where our ideal clients hang out."
