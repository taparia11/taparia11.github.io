(That's by comparing against Superpath’s compensation survey figures; by comparing against a salary survey I'm doing among many content folks; and because I've had access to compensation data purchased from Radford and such for the past seven years. Plus, when I led a large content team at NerdWallet for years, we crowd-sourced all the offers that folks on our team would share when they were being recruited; our team was continually heavily recruited. And I've spent the past eight+ years hiring 100+ content folks for my teams, so I’ve been seeing negotiated numbers for many candidates.)\n\nI mention the above, because some people think degrees are the best path toward good jobs. I've not found that to be the case at all. And I've never even prioritized money — I love producing results, and money is a byproduct. Of course, it really helps to know how to negotiate. I've built those skills over years and I leverage everything I know about compensation across the landscape. While money isn't my highest priority, I try to never leave money on the table. That’s because you get more respect as an exec if you know how to negotiate, and you want to build credibility not only for you, but for the function and people you represent. (This is why I tell people to avoid working for managers who can't represent well; no matter how talented you are, you'll tend to get shorted by working for a weak manager. That's bc they're the ones responsible for getting your function resources and recognition.)",
