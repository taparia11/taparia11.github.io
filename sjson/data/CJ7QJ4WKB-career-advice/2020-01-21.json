I'm more than likely overthinking this, but...\n\nI was contacted last month about a job opening in my area at a large company in the manufacturing industry. The position is for a content marketing manager who would manage a copywriter, help with strategy to some extent, and do copywriting the rest of the time (from what I can tell). I told the recruiter that I am really looking for remote positions or to go full time freelance in the next couple of months, but he said to just give it a try and see what happens.\n\nHe called me yesterday and said they are about to send the offer letter, and it will be 30-40% what I'm making at my current job :astonished:.\n\nThis is exciting, but I'm also torn. I really was hoping my next move would be to a remote position or freelance FT, and the position itself sounds a little boring, but the offer is one I can't take lightly. I'm in the interview process with a remote startup that would offer slightly more than I'm making now, but the position sounds more exciting than the job that pays more. I let them know that I'd be receiving an offer in the next day or so from the other company (they told me to tell them if\/when I did), but they said I am the furthest along in the interview process and they need a few more days to interview the other candidates to make an informed decision.\n\nI guess what I'm wondering is whether I should go with the high-paying job that might not be exactly what I want, or if I should hold out for a remote position (or to go FT freelance once my husband has insurance in a few months).",
