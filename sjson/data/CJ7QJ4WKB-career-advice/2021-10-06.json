I am currently freelancing for this type of role for money. However, I have also been working as a freelance copywriter for the last 2 years.\n\nUntil recently I worked as a content specialist\/freelance copywriter for a startup but they ran out of money. I haven´t been able to get consistent work as a copywriter or content specialist (sometimes those have overlapped a bit?), so sometimes I also take SEM jobs. Deep down I am tired of SEM (although it does involve some writing) and I have a passion for writing and content all things related. I have been doing good jobs I think with some content training from LinkedIn and other sources and would love to grow a career on it, but I need money.\n\nDo I keep on working on SEM jobs to make money while I try to capture clients? What are the best sources and tactics to capture clients? I can write both in Spanish and English. I´m Spanish and live in Spain: do you think I can work within the US market?\n\nThanks for reading and sorry if I threw on too many ideas at once.",
