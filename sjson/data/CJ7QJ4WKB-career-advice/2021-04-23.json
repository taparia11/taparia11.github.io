This is a way for folks to ask anonyous questions. \n\nCareer stage: senior (8+ years)\n\n\"My company is growing rapidly and so is our marketing team. There are so many inputs for content strategy to support business direction. \n\nIt feels like we're growing in every area at once, all in ways I haven't done or led before. I don't think I have impostor syndrome, rather, I feel like I just dove in headfirst and have no idea which way to swim. \n\nAny advice on how you've worked through similar high-growth and high-learning periods?\"",

I have a degree in English &amp; Writing, but I honestly don’t talk about it that much (and no one ever asks about it) because it’s from a small, regional college no one really knows about. And my career has been a winding one where my longest tenure is 3 years, and the rest of my stints have been about a year due to a lot of things – at first it was because I was just taking jobs to gain experience &amp; exposure, then it was a little bit out of boredom, and recently, it’s been because I’ve been recruited away to other jobs, or I’ve had big lifestyle changes (I had a baby!), and I need a schedule that works.\n\nAll of this to say, here’s what I’ve done when I have felt similarly:\n\n• Start volunteering to do content\/marketing work for a nonprofit. This looks great on a portfolio, and it can truly give you invaluable experiences and new skills. \n• Continue your education loudly and proudly. This could mean joining a local marketers group or taking courses (I hear Superpath has some great ones :slightly_smiling_face: Not only you can you put these on a portfolio, but talk about them in interviews and coffee meetings. Talk about why you joined and what you’ve learned. People LOVE working with people who care about what they’re doing. And you seeking out learning opportunities for more than just a line item on a resume is a great way to show that. \n• I created a virtual “praise jar” for myself. Sounds super cheesy, but I have a folder I keep in my inbox where I keep words of encouragement or compliments on my work. Sometimes, they’re just a couple of sentences saying, “This looks great!” Other times, their follow-ups to projects or meetings where someone I’ve worked with had some kinds things to share. This has really helped with my imposter syndrome, and there have been times where I’ve asked these colleagues to be used as references or use their words as part of a testimonial. \n• Finally, if you’re having a day where you’re feeling down about your experience, ask for a chance to show your stuff! Most jobs have a type of writing sample or assessment as part of the interview process. Embrace that, ask for it, and let there be where you shine. \nRooting for you from afar!!
