This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: mid (4-7 years of experience)\n\n\"Since I've started working in tech, I've noticed that constant pivoting is a norm in this industry. From messaging to product names to even strategy and audience, the tech space is one of constant experimentation. \n\nWhile testing is essential when trying to understand how to best market and position the company, I also feel like pivoting all the time doesn't allow you to build anything. At times, it feels counterproductive, especially when you've created content that now feels like a waste of time and money because of the change in direction. \n\nSo my question is, what advice do you have for someone to better navigate changes that impact the content and the content strategy. How does one build flexibility into the actual content piece and plan? \"",
