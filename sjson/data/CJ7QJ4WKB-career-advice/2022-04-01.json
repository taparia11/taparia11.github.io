You also have subject matter expertise which can be a value add for brands.\n\nIf you market yourself as a health and wellness writer, rather than a generalist, (at least) two big things happen:\n\n1. Clients see as you as such, and are more likely to hire a specialist in their niche than a generalist (typically).\n2. You can focus your outreach in one area, and develop a network in the space where you might start to get referred (even before writing for them). \nI'd also suggest finding brands you're already aware of that have blogs. These companies already know the value of content and don't need to be educated constantly like an individual \/ local business would, and are therefore more consistent (and happy to pay for that value).",
