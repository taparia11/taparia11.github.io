I certainly could've done better and come up with the final draft, but the way I understood it we would be working on the task for at least 2 more weeks, so I gave it 90% instead of 100%, figuring more editing would go into it. That was my first mistake.\n2. Not contractually required to, so I won't finish the second task, I'd be wasting my time and theirs.\n3. You're right, I'll consider this, and their feedback on it, as a chance to improve rather than a setback.\nThank you again! Best of luck to you too.",
