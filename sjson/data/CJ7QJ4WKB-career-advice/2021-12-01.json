This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: junior (1-3 years of experience)\n\n\"I'm a marketer with ~3 years of experience. I've been working as the solo marketer at a startup for a year now. My background is in content, but obviously as the marketing team of one, I've been doing a little bit of everything. Our team is growing and I've discussed my desire to do more with content and level up my content career with our CEO (who I report to). With annual reviews coming up, I'm certain that I need to come up with some goals for the next year (and my career in general). I do everything right now — SEO, thought leadership, general website stuff, social, and a bunch of other non-content stuff. \n\nIt feels embarrassing to ask but... I don't know what my goals should be. I want to continue to learn, I want to possibly help new\/aspiring content marketers get a taste of the content world, and I want to take on new responsibilities so I can grow... but I don't really know what actual goals should be. If you were advising a junior-ish marketer on how to grow in their career, what would you recommend? How do you start the \"next phase\" of a content career? Thank you for any advice. \n\"",

Examples could be:\n• Generate 2x as many leads as last year\n• Grow lead generation 2x quarter over quarter\n I also think <@ULJBEFSJJ>’s recommendation to talk openly with your CEO \/ marketing leader is CRITICAL :slightly_smiling_face:  not only will this show your head is in the right place, it will also create more alignment, trust, and openness between you two, AND lead to the best possible goals. Truly an awesome recommendation, don’t ignore this.\n\nFinally, for your _personal_ career goals, I recommend following your curiosity and *experimenting with side projects*. Getting curious to learn more about TikTok ads? Pitch a the founder of a startup you like on running some for them, and why it would make sense! (Or, just do it on your own dime if you’re willing &amp; able.) This type of initiative-taking leads to rapid learning and, often, awesome new work opportunities :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nUltimately you will start to get clarity on the specific areas of marketing that you want to hone in on, like <@UP6K3LYQ7> said. It’s counterintuitive, but important to niche down, in order to become sought-out for what _you_ do best.",
