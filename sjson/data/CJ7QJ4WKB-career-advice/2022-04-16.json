With content marketing work it's a lot of writing\/reading and sometimes it feels like school where you are constantly researching and working on assignments, so when I start feeling burnt out I try to spend time away from screens and do activities that I can actively engage in (workout classes, going to the park, going to the beach, going out to eat in a restaurant). It really depends on what you enjoy and what you like, but physical activity helps me refresh myself (or going on a vacation).",
