This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: junior (1-3 years of experience)\n\n\"Hi lovely Super folks.\n\nAs I prep for the new year, I've got a bomb of a question that I've asked many at the peak of their freelance writing career. I'm still looking for more insights and would love if you guys would take a moment to chime in.\n\nI'm a non-native speaker of English. \n\nI've been hired by countless native speakers, but bigger brands seem to be apprehensive of hiring me. As I enter 2022, I'm determined to find a way to break this barrier. Here are the two questions I have:\n1. Is it possible, as a non-native, to make it big, and do you know anyone who has?\n2. If yes, how?\n\nThank you - and I'm grateful of being part of such a resourceful community! :)\"",
