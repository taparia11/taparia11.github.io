This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: junior (1-3 years of experience)\n\n\"I've just been hired as a lead writer for a high-growth company that does not have a formalized content process. It's my first week on the job and  my boss just quit. I was hired to help execute a content strategy but now, there is no one to create it to begin with. I am now without a boss (reporting to a higher level marketing executive with his hands full) and I've stepped up to try and help formulate a content strategy myself but as someone who came in as a writer I don't have the experience, just trying to do all the research I can do get an editorial calendar together and get started. My weakest point is the metrics, the measurable aspects of a content strat. Does anyone have advice about what they'd do in this situation? I want to step up but also understand my limitations. Any resources you'd recommend to teach myself what I need to know?\"",

If content is primarily a brand awareness\/community-building play, you might focus on metrics like email subscribers, followers on social, sessions, or page views. \n\nIf content is more about engaging and nurturing leads, you could look at things like average time on page, # of pages viewed per session, or email opens\/clicks. \n\nIf there’s a heavy focus on acquiring leads, you can look at new users, content downloads, email subscribers, etc. ",

If content is primarily a brand awareness\/community-building play, you might focus on metrics like email subscribers, followers on social, sessions, or page views. \n\nIf content is more about engaging and nurturing leads, you could look at things like average time on page, # of pages viewed per session, or email opens\/clicks. \n\nIf there’s a heavy focus on acquiring leads, you can look at new users, content downloads, email subscribers, etc. "
