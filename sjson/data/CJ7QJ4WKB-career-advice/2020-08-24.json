I was offered the position for the more senior role that I was initially hesitant about taking. I ultimately weighed the pros and cons, and decided that it would be worth it to leave my toxic workplace and join at team where (even if it wasn't my forever home) would be a great opportunity to learn something new and challenge myself. I AM SO HAPPY WITH THIS DECISION. I am 3 weeks into working for this new company and have already been given so much trust and freedom to execute, plus an appropriate budget and realistic goals. My boss listens to my ideas and is a reasonable person who is able to articulate his point when we don't agree. It is a startup, but they want to build a brand and care more about doing things right rather than just getting tons of leads (whaaaat?!) Not only that, the product is much cooler than they made it sound, so there's a pretty excellent opportunity for content marketing since that is not at all clear on the site or anywhere that we talk about it. Low hanging fruit! I voluntarily worked on the weekend because I was excited about my job which has literally not happened in over 2 years. Thanks again to everyone for their advice- it really helped me make the right call.",
