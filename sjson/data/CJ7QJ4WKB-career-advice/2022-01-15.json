I'd also sign up to receive emails from brands that are in the industry you're looking to do email marketing in. For example, if you're looking to do email marketing for eCommerce brands, sign up to receive emails from different companies you like, and go on their websites after you make accounts and do different things like put an item in your cart and then go off the site, you can get an idea of what kind of journey they take people on. I recommend you also look at how these brands do subject lines, how much time in between emails, what kind of offers they have. Courses are great too, and YouTube has a lot of great tutorials.",
