This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: senior (8+ years)\n\n\"I'm in my mid-30s, and have been working in content for around a decade. I started my career as a journalist, then transitioned over to content and loved everything about it. That said, with each passing year, I feel like the old person in the room.\n\nIs content a young person's game? And (for the sake of discussion), for anyone looking to transition out of content marketing but still stay in marketing, what's another niche of marketing that fits a content skillset?\"",
