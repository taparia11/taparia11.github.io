        "text": "Hi <@U01J3P3EVDL>. Here is my 2 cents:\n*What is your biggest piece of advice for setting your rates as a beginner?*\nStay flexible. You’re almost definitely undercharging at the beginning, but that might be a rite of passage you have to go through if you don’t have a portfolio or other niche experience to point to. If you don’t have a portfolio to lean on, consider offering a discounted rate as a trial with new clients, but make it clear to the client that your rates will increase after a certain amount of articles or time together. It takes experimentation to find the right rate, and just know that your rates will inevitably change over time. The more experience you gain and the fuller your work pipeline, the way leeway you have to keep space for the types of projects that align with your prices, expertise, and values.\n\n*What is the biggest no-no you can think of when setting your rates?*\nUnless you’re just getting your bearings as a freelancer, avoid charging by the hour. If your goal is to build long-term relationships with clients or become a subject matter expert, you’ll become faster with each article. This not only lowers your hourly earning potential, it also punishes you for creating content that’s perfectly in tune with your client’s voice or industry’s lexicon. My preference is per-article billing. If you feel unsure about how to price an article, you can always do a behind-the-scenes calculation based on your baseline hourly rate. To do this, roughly estimate how long you think the article (including admin, research, writing, editing, and other other steps in the process) will take. Multiply that amount of time by the minimum you’d want to earn per hour. (Keep in mind your hourly rate should feel a little inflated compared to what you may earn at a standard hourly job.) Then you may even want to pad the figure a bit to take into account any unforeseeable hold-ups, costs of running your business, and taxes.\n\n\nHappy to edit down or clarify as needed! Good luck with the article! <http:\/\/www.ashleesang.com|www.ashleesang.com>",
