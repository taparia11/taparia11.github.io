I started off as a blogger , moved on to content creation  but in the last 6 years I have  worked as a copywriter, sales writer and content writer for advertising agencies.\n2 years ago, I chose to become a freelance writer and to be honest its been one hell of a journey. I have had to tolerate getting  underpaid and working my back off all in the name of building a client list and some consistent income.\nIn the last 8 months, I have had to sit down to give myself a talk. It's almost like I am giving all of my time for a penny. I feel like it's so unfair that I get to experience this despite my level of experience.\nI have seen writers who work half the time but earn 7x of what I do working round the clock .\n\nI am here to ask for pointers in how to secure remote content writing or  copywriting jobs that won't drain my blood. Companies that would appreciate my experience by rewarding me with a good pay.\nI don't mind signing up with recruitment agencies. I feel like it's time I got paid  properly for my expertise.\n\nPs\" I have worked as a copywriter for brands like Guinness,  Nike Foundation, Anno Cider , Conterro, USAID, etc, just to give you an idea of my expertise.\n\nThanks alot people.",

I started off as a blogger , moved on to content creation  but in the last 6 years I have  worked as a copywriter, sales writer and content writer for advertising agencies.\n2 years ago, I chose to become a freelance writer and to be honest its been one hell of a journey. I have had to tolerate getting  underpaid and working my back off all in the name of building a client list and some consistent income.\nIn the last 8 months, I have had to sit down to give myself a talk. It's almost like I am giving all of my time for a penny. I feel like it's so unfair that I get to experience this despite my level of experience.\nI have seen writers who work half the time but earn 7x of what I do working round the clock .\n\nI am here to ask for pointers in how to secure remote content writing or  copywriting jobs that won't drain my blood. Companies that would appreciate my experience by rewarding me with a good pay.\nI don't mind signing up with recruitment agencies. I feel like it's time I got paid  properly for my expertise.\n\nPs\" I have worked as a copywriter for brands like Guinness,  Nike Foundation, Anno Cider , Conterro, USAID, etc, just to give you an idea of my expertise.\n\nThanks alot people."
