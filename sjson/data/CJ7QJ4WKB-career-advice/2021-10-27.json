This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: mid (4-7 years of experience)\n\n\"I'm currently a first-time content marketing manager in talks with a company for a more senior role. Things never really got off the ground at my current job, and while there were wins I was able to drive, I haven't had a lot of usable experience due to a micromanaging boss who has blocked most of my work in favor of things outside of the purview of my job description.\n\nI have read loads and loads about content, SEO, the works, so I know more than my experience would let on, but am very aware that reading =\/= doing and I'm worried about getting in over my head. Would you recommend taking it if offered and just working hard to try to make things work? Or does the risk of failure outweigh the potential reward from nailing it? \n\nIf anyone has been in this situation and would be willing to speak with me, please comment below and I'll reach out.\"",
