This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: mid (4-7 years of experience)\n\n\"I've recently accepted a remote job offer at an SF-based content agency. I'm based in a part of Europe where salaries are much lower than in the States. \n\nThe job I got pays really well (about 10x more than the average yearly salary in my country) BUT I feel I'm unfairly paid when compared to my peers that do the exact same work as me producing work of the same quality as me. \n\nI'm just wondering what to do? I don't want to change jobs as I'm quite satisfied with every other aspect here except for the pay, as I believe I'm very underpaid for the work I do (about 60% less).\"",

I would suggest a couple other things to help you challenge that inner critic voice (that says stuff like: ‘you aren’t good enough for this job. you are over your skis.’)\n\n1. Remind yourself of all you know --- fill your work space with evidence of your good work, skill and expertise (the thank you notes, the awards, the credentials, etc. — sometimes we forget our good stuff.)\n2. Put some post notes up at your computer monitor — ‘they hired me because….. fill in the blank.’   Sometimes organizations hire people that bring a different range of experiences — in strategic organizations this is a power move. \n3. Reach out to a trusted professional contact that you have worked with before --- tell them how you are feeling — and ask them to help you reconnect to what you are awesome at. We rarely see our Zone of Genius without someone else there to reflect it back. Our best stuff is often stuff we come by naturally to a degree — and it may not feel special because we didn’t have to work super duper hard for it. \n4. Stay aligned to your new boss --- check in for feedback — “what are three things I’m doing well here.”  “what are three things you want me to get better at.” \nRemember when you start a new job — you are at the bottom of an S curve — and learning about how to navigate and apply your skills. Rising on the S curve can take time — 6 to 12 months even… be patient.",
