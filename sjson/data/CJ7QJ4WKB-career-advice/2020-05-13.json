Our policy is 16 weeks fully paid for new parents (any way of adding a child to your family, and for both primary or secondary caregiver status) and I believe this cannot be combined with PTO as it is leave. We have a very active Parents Business Resource Group that has shared resources with others in tech  and I could probably share more details on our policy or connect you with someone from the group!\n\nMy hope is that you will be able to take as much time as possible with your family and your company will support that.
