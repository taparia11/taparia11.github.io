        "text": "I'm new to this community and I might be late. But I still want to thank <@UJG9WTEKG> and <@UJE5LQ2JC> for doing this <https:\/\/superpath.co\/blog\/sean-blanda-on-learning-or-earning|podcast>. After listening to it, I spent a sleepless Saturday night, reflecting on my next career moves. Around 3 am, I then went on to read many other articles on <http:\/\/seanblanda.com|seanblanda.com>.\n\nHere are 3 of my biggest takeaways. Wanted to share this here as I thought other early\/ mid-career writers on this channel may find this useful too... Even otherwise, I wanted to share this for the selfish reason of holding my own self accountable.\n\n*#1 Clark Kent is okay, but being Superman is way more awesome and purposeful.*\nSean points out the difference between a _\"creating content\"_ mindset VS _\"owning business outcomes\"_ mindset in this <https:\/\/www.seanblanda.com\/what-i-wish-i-knew-five-years-ago-about-building-a-career-in-content\/|article>. As in _\"creating 3 blogs + 10 tweets every week\"_ VS _\"Increase sign-ups by xx%\"_. According to me, the first is Clark Kent mode. It's useful in a narrow sense, and may even get the job done. But to be truly useful, you need to become superman, by using of all your strategic superpowers. This means stretching yourself beyond your comfort zone (eg: finding evidence of how the content helped achieve better biz outcomes) and more fighting with your villains (imposter syndrome, internal politics, perfection traps etc).\n\nHow do you develop these content superpowers?\n&gt; In Sean's own words: _\"understand what drives the company's long-term growth and focus maniacally on that...\"_\n_Becoming superman: <https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/cdb0ZiwjjwOe4\/giphy.gif>_\n\n*#2 Build, own and serve your audience.*\nIn this <https:\/\/www.seanblanda.com\/the-most-defensible-thing-you-can-do-for-your-career-build-an-audience\/|article>, Sean set my thinking straight. He made it clear that good quality (even impactful) work is only the basis for a good career. Yes, you might find it deeply satisfying and surely your co-workers appreciate your craft. But in the real world this alone might not be enough. Because of all the different variables (changes in economy, your industry, company, team or even incompetent bosses\/ managers) involved. So as you progress in your career and you begin to develop deep skills - you also need to think about cultivating your audience.\n\nYour audience also doubles up as your force multipliers. Want to make a career move, hire someone awesome or collaborate with the right team? Your audience will help you. That is if you've been able to cultivate a specific set of people who respect your skills, beliefs, execution and values.\n\n&gt; _Personal note to myself: 40 of your true blog audience who are invested in you &gt; 1,000 generic linkedIn followers who don't care that much about you or your work. So yes, I'm going to start a blog and cultivate a direct relationship with my audience._\n*#3 Be unapologetic about learning and earning.*\nSean's words helped me narrow down my career priorities into two words - learn &amp; earn. If you're not doing either, it's probably time to move on. Prioritizing also helped me examine my limiting beliefs. In my case, I used to tell myself - _I have a decade of consulting experience but only a year in content. Also, I live in India. Both mean that I can't charge more than 100$ per article_. Reflecting on this made me adopt a different stance. Instead of thinking about me and putting a limit on what I think I'm worth - I'm now choosing to think about my clients\/ company and how I can help them achieve strategic objectives (refer #1). And that way I can be unapologetic prioritizing my next career moves around earning and learning.\n\nThank you once again <@UJE5LQ2JC> for these insights. I hope, I haven't offended your views or diluted your perspectives in any way.\n\nAnd thank you anyone else for reading this.",
