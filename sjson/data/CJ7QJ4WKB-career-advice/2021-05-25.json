This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: junior (1-3 years of experience)\n\n\"Hello everyone,\nI started working as a freelance content marketer (B2B tech and SaaS niche) in March 2020. Before that, I applied and looked for a full-time job but didn't get any. I don't have extensive knowledge\/experience working as a content marketer; I am a total newbie from a developing country. I also finished graduation from maths in January. That's my background, nothing fancy. Whatever, I know I learned from blogs, books and groups.\n\nUntil March 2021, it was all going well. I had a few client's (some from Linkedin, some from cold emailing), but one by one, they all stopped working with me. Reason: my writing skills aren't up to par. Now, this is becoming a very stressful situation because I'm not sure what should I do. I know they are many areas that I lag, and I'm trying everything that I can do—like, using Grammarly, getting it to proofread. But nothing is working. Now, I don't have any clients. It's very depressing. I'm trying to land new client's, but nothing is working anymore. What should I do? I was thinking of hiring an editor\/mentor who can guide me, especially in my writing part, but I don't have any money. I'm stuck. Please, help me. \n\"",

And do you know of any great mentorship programs for women in tech\/content? Thanks so much :pray:",

        "text": "Hi <@U01AHL8AGBB> thank you so much for the insight!! I agree about the made up “specialist” title. :sweat_smile: Are you speaking from an in-house perspective?\n\nHere’s a bit more insight into our organization. I work at a growth marketing agency so for the most part each employee is one of the below roles, which is why we don’t bucket them as “digital marketers.”\n• content marketing specialist\/strategist\n• growth marketing specialist\/strategist\n• paid acquisition specialist\/strategist\nHow many people we have in each position basically depends on how many clients we have. At the moment we have around 10 people in each bucket\/speciality. Then there’s usually a content, growth, and PA person on each client team and every person typically manages around 3 clients at a time.

I'm not in-house these days but my ire about those titles does stem from my time in-house and at an agency\n\nideas for the rubric:\n\n• *associated conversion success rate(s)* - across all clients or client teams, what's your conversation rate look like? you'll need standardize this in some way since all clients are different. this also helps normalize out differences in revenue, which is a tempting metric but kinda secondary to conversion\n• *associated growth rate* - same deal, but tracking whatever counts as growth for the client. prolly revenue, but maybe it's followers for some. Expresses as a % as well so that nice\n• *Tenure with organization* - adjust this as you see fit, helps to control outlier situations and give some reward to those with longer tenures\nIf you're an individual spread across 6.5 teams in this kinda flat, loose structure, I'd think it'd be fair to base those metrics off a selection of maybe your top 5 teams\/clients. Or an option to drop the two lowest scores as a way to balance outliers in the negative direction.\n\nOnce someone hits an appreciable level in the rubric, they're invited to maybe author a strategy deck or post mortem or something as part of their path to getting that higher rank? The deck is put to the test with a live client, with its own rubric or maybe just the same idea of testing conversion.",
