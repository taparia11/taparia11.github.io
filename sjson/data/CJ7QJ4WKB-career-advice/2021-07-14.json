January is only 6 months away, I’d use that time to continue doing awesome work and then use the delay as leverage in your negotiations. (Remember those six months you made me wait? I think it’s only fair to get a salary top-up to compensate.) If you have a good relationship with someone in HR I might go to them and get confirmation that they’re planning to add a position to promote you to. I *definitely* would not take it personally. ",
