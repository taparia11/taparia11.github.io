I am also open to social media management.\n\nI've done a few content writer role interviews and the tricky  bit is experience, that's the feedback I get from hiring managers.\n\nI'm curious and interested in marketing. I tool an 8 month accelerator course in digital marketing and it grew in me that curiosity.\n\nI was thinking of applying for roles with marketing companies that I love and grow into my ideal role.\n\nWhat would be your thoughts?\n\nWhat other titles would you suggest I explore in B2B, B2C?\n\nThank you!",
