The last one paints a picture of the career path so you get. a sense of where you're headed.\n\nSince writing\/producing content is the gateway to this profession, freelancing is key to building your portfolio. In fact, your portfolio is important as you progress. I've got 10+ years in and am still asked to share samples.\n\nMy advice — sign up for a creative freelance agency to get your feet wet. As you build a portfolio, look for small startups vs larger companies.\n\nNetworking is absolutely critical right now. Everyone is trying to get in and too many hiring leaders aren't even sure what they're looking for or need. A strong network will connect you to opportunities while honing your skills.",

The last one paints a picture of the career path so you get. a sense of where you're headed.\n\nSince writing\/producing content is the gateway to this profession, freelancing is key to building your portfolio. In fact, your portfolio is important as you progress. I've got 10+ years in and am still asked to share samples.\n\nMy advice — sign up for a creative freelance agency to get your feet wet. As you build a portfolio, look for small startups vs larger companies.\n\nNetworking is absolutely critical right now. Everyone is trying to get in and too many hiring leaders aren't even sure what they're looking for or need. A strong network will connect you to opportunities while honing your skills."
