Here’s my two cents as both a previous editing team lead and senior account manager:\n• Speak less, listen more, and ask a lot of questions (whether you’re managing up or down)\n• Leverage your team’s strengths, not their weaknesses (this includes working individually on each team member’s strengths)\n• Always remember you’re a guide to getting results (this will help avoid micromanaging)\n• Also be a guide when you’re helping people grow (and understand that not everyone will want to grow - some are just happy where they are)\n• Don’t be afraid to play devil’s advocate, especially when you’re managing up. (IMHO, not enough people do this and can stifle their own creativity and innovation).\n• When you’re not afraid to speak up, this will show your team they can also be frank and express doubts when they have them.\n• Admit your mistakes.\n• Whenever you’re communicating important info, like changes or new processes or goals, always explain the WHY! And whey you finish communicating, sum up what you just said in one sentence including the why. \n• Sometimes star employees are overrated. Remember the quiet ones - you may strike gold. \n• Get some basic coaching skills under your belt. \n• I often used <http:\/\/mindtools.com|mindtools.com> in the beginning of my career. The free version had a lot of useful info. \nI could go on and on, but I think these are the main ones. Feel free to DM me whenever you feel overwhelmed, need to vent, or want advice.
