        "text": "Hi <@UL4TUV38B> My career started very similarly. Writing for myself and freelancing, then writing for other publications like 99u, Fast Co, etc.\n\nTwo questions I wish I had asked myself earlier. 1) What lights you up? (Do more of that.) 2) What do you NOT want to do, no matter how much $$ is on the table? The path of a writer can take so many routes, as you’ve outlined.\n\nMy last gig was Head of Content for CreativeMornings—the largest face-to-face creative community. I’ll follow the format as the generous friends above shared.\n\n*what that actually means*: I owned, managed, and shaped the voice of the organization. With ~200 videos uploaded a month, 22,000 monthly attendees, 1500 volunteers around the world, and keeping a pulse on creative communities in 205 cities, most of the time I was a bird’s eye view of what was happening in our universe. My role, over time, taught me how to curate. It taught me how to build systems. It taught me how to scale efforts without using more energy.\n*what i was responsible for*: Two newsletters, all social media channels (5k tweets a year, 300 IG posts a year), copywriting, global campaigns with partners, the blog (didn’t have a crazy publishing engine, the weekly newsletter was the main attraction), strategy for new endeavors, and supporting the global community with interesting content\/stories\/insights happening at events.\n*how my week breaks down:* No day was the same. Monday’s I spent 5-7 hours on just the weekly newsletter. Tuesday, deep focused writing while scheduling TW\/Fb\/IG for 1.5 weeks out so I don’t think about it. Rest of the week depended on upcoming projects, events, campaigns, etc.\n*what’s great about this:* I wore every  hat imaginable, and it taught me how to connect different skills and outputs in interesting ways. Because of this, I had more leverage, more resources, and overall more autonomy. I learned how to grow not just the content side of a business, but the business overall. Our game was brand affinity, not conversion, so it’s a bit different than most content people in this community.\n*what sucks:* You’re doing the work of 2 if not 3 full-time people, yet not getting paid 3 salaries. I was pretty much at a non-profit. It’s easy to get burnt out with all the social media work, which felt futile over time. You need to have friends\/supporters that are not knee-deep in this work so they can provide you clear feedback that points at things you aren’t seeing. And the role, if not managed, can keep growing more and more, until a year out you’re looking at your plate and wondering how things got on there.",
