But rather than get another degree, I studied on my own, learned on the job and volunteer-coached for two years at a tech incubator (they accepted me based on a recommendation from someone they trusted).

But content has reached a tipping point — with more and more companies realizing that they're must-have jobs to acquire users and compete, because traditional marketing’s effectiveness has waned over years. That means there will be increasing opportunities for content leaders who think like business people.

It’s a subtle change, and you’re already doing it in some places, but could impact how you’re perceived.\n• The first role on your resume is Customer Marketing Manager and someone has to scroll to the bottom of page 1 to get to content marketing experience (although I do recognize that your current role has elements of a content role). Your headline on LinkedIn also starts with “Customer Marketer”. This might cause an ATS or hiring manager to skip over you because it may create the perception that you’re changing fields. One way I’ve seen this addressed is to list all your roles on Page 1 and then get into the details on subsequent pages. This also allows you to pare your resume down to 1 page when needed.\nFinally, my one question for you is: do you always submit a cover letter? If not, I highly highly recommend it for content roles, especially senior ones. I personally prioritize qualified applicants with strong cover letters over those who didn’t submit one. It’s a piece of content marketing that proves you can walk the walk.",

The first one is customer marketing, and if I were skimming the resume (which sadly lots of recruiters do) I don't think there is enough \"Content Manager\" roles jumping out at me. Is there anything you can do with the titles to make them a bit more senior?\n\nSecond making this more results and data focused. Do you have an online portfolio\/website? As someone who recently interviewed for these types of roles, everyone needed to see an online portfolio that was project based vs writing sample based.\n\nIf you'd like I can share my resume and online portfolio (it's a work in progress for sure but could be good to peak at someone else in the same hiring spot).",

The first one is customer marketing, and if I were skimming the resume (which sadly lots of recruiters do) I don't think there is enough \"Content Manager\" roles jumping out at me. Is there anything you can do with the titles to make them a bit more senior?\n\nSecond making this more results and data focused. Do you have an online portfolio\/website? As someone who recently interviewed for these types of roles, everyone needed to see an online portfolio that was project based vs writing sample based.\n\nIf you'd like I can share my resume and online portfolio (it's a work in progress for sure but could be good to peak at someone else in the same hiring spot)."

Often, people have very arbitrary reasons for assigning one title or another and it's something you can influence during the recruiting process too."
