Immerse myself in the business unit--competitors, challenges, differentiators, leader names. Spend time building rapport with day-to-day team. Explore the entire breadth of content (qual and quant).\n\n60 Days: Keep my head down to work on small projects and demonstrate proficiency. Keep notes on process improvement. Start to build alliances with high performers to learn what makes them exceed department expectations.\n\n90 Days: Propose 1-2 new initiatives or processes based on past three months of experiences. Point out ownable quick wins over the last three months and vision for the next three months."
