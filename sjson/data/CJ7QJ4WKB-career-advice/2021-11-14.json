There’s a lot of advice out there for freelancers about how you should _know your worth_ and price accordingly. As content creators, aside from working out what you need to charge to stay afloat from your side of the table, how can you _know your worth_ from the client’s perspective? If their content marketing system isn’t sophisticated enough (I’ve honestly never had a client that could do this), and if you’re helping them work towards a long-term payoff with their content marketing, how can you genuinely _know your worth_? How do you put a dollar figure on an abstract idea? Is there a way to do this other than simply comparing it to relevant salary data, etc.?",
