He seemed interested at first, but when I showed him the breakdown, he was skeptical because the cost of contractors is more than the ad spend for running a month of ads. I thought this made sense because it's all about the execution and would hate throw more money at the ad spend without properly setting up the campaign and optimizing and measuring it throughout the 30 days. I interviewed a fb ad specialist and have taken workshops on setting up FB ads, and have run ads in the past, but maybe my budget is off. Would anyone with experience running fb ads be willing to look at my proposal or have any advise on a ratio of ad spend to labor cost?",
