If you have an HR department, you can work with them and your manager to figure out what will help you the most while not impacting your team in a negative way (maybe flexible work hours, work-from-home days if struggling in the office, days with no meetings, etc.) You can also take unpaid time off via FMLA (assuming you’ve been employed there for over a year), and it doesn’t have to be a huge chunk of time; it can literally be a day or two, I believe.\n\nYou can also find an advocate to help you navigate this process (ask your doctor to start; there are probably many online and\/or local resources, and your insurance company MAY be able to help)&gt;\n\nI’ve been pretty outspoken about my mental health for the last 5 or so years. With one exception (a manager that literally said, “I was depressed once; you just need to get out of bed and get moving” :face_with_rolling_eyes: I’ve had nothing but support and, in many cases, other co-workers feeling ‘safe’ to express their own challenges, on whatever level.\n\nYou are always your own best advocate; your first concern should be what is best for you, acknowledging where YOUR comfort zone is, and being kind to yourself when you have a bad day (or week or month).\n\nFeel free to DM me if you ever want to talk in more details, and best of luck to you!",
