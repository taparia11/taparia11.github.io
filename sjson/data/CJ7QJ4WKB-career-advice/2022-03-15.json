I am aiming to pivot my career to a content marketing writer role after many years in digital communications and web management for nonprofits. I am interested in seeing what a great resume looks like for content writers in various stages of their careers: junior, mid-level, and senior writers. Also interested in seeing resumes from folks who work in different settings: agencies, in-house -- and in various industries. My particular niche interests are B2B Saas and software for web development and design, email, and digital marketing. But I'd love to see content writing resumes from any industry. Are any folks out there willing to share with me their resumes? I am in the process of revamping mine and would love to see great examples and models to take inspiration from. Thanks! DMs are ok",

I am aiming to pivot my career to a content marketing writer role after many years in digital communications and web management for nonprofits. I am interested in seeing what a great resume looks like for content writers in various stages of their careers: junior, mid-level, and senior writers. Also interested in seeing resumes from folks who work in different settings: agencies, in-house -- and in various industries. My particular niche interests are B2B Saas and software for web development and design, email, and digital marketing. But I'd love to see content writing resumes from any industry. Are any folks out there willing to share with me their resumes? I am in the process of revamping mine and would love to see great examples and models to take inspiration from. Thanks! DMs are ok"
