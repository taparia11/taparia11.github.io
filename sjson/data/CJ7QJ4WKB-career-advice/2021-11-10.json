I have 2-3 years of work experience.

It’s a bit of a red flag to me that it may be Comms Manager or Marketing Lead because those are two very different jobs. And I would not expect that someone with only 2-3 years of experience would take on the role of Marketing Lead, unless it was a very early-stage startup with an inexperienced team overall. Another important consideration is will you be an individual contributor, or will you be doing work plus managing other employees? Typically, managers make more because they have much more responsibility."
