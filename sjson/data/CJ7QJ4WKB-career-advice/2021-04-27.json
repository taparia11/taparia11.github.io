This is a way for folks to ask anonyous questions. \n\nCareer stage: entry (0-1 years of experience)\n\n\"Hello. I am struggling with writing plagiarism-free content. Recently I got fired from the company where I have been working as a content writer. And the reason that I got fired is that I have used scam tools for plagiarism detection and it doesn't detect the plagiarized piece of content. Any advice on how to improve your writing in case you don't have an appropriate budget for using premium tools)\"",
