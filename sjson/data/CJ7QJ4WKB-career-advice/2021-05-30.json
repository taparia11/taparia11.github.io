This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: mid (4-7 years of experience)\n\n\"Hi all,\n\nI'm currently looking to transition out of agency life. I have about four years of content experience all together, but I'm having a hard time finding positions for mid-level content marketers. \n\nWhen I look at job boards, I see tons of junior content writer positions and plenty of senior content marketing manager positions but very few positions for people of my experience level. The former pay way below what I make now and the latter require ~8+ years of experience. \n\nDoes anyone have advice for finding mid-level positions or otherwise building my skills up?\"",

        "text": "Hi. Can you freelance on the side? That is the best way to feed your internal desire for new and interesting projects while also having a secure  job where you are a part of something bigger. Most full-time gigs lose their magic over time no matter how exciting they seem. It's nice to have that side project to keep you sharp. The best part of having a secure job is you pick and choose side projects you care about.\n\nMy experience as a 100% freelancer is that it's a constant hustle. Things can be great now, but projects slow down and the chances of the next project aligning with your passions are slim. Another possibility is to work out a long-term contract with your current freelance client if they are willing. Just some random Sunday thoughts. Good luck.",
