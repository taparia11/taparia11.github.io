I’ve done both freelance and 9-5s, and a big difference IMO is the other tasks a more permanent role brings. \n\nFor example, do you like attending meetings, editing other people’s work, and refreshing older content on a regular basis? These routines come with the package of a “regular” job. (Of course, a good company also provides career development and a coworkers who share your exerience, which is a plus!)\n\nOn the other hand, if writing is what you mainly love to do, and you prefer writing for a variety of industries, maybe try a part time role to start? You can get a feel for working in a company, while also not putting too much pressure on yourself when pitching for freelance projects. ",
