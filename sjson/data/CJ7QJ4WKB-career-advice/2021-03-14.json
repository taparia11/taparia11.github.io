For eBay, it was an email campaign for TEDxSanFrancisco with a 70's pop culture reference that got me in.\n\nGenerally speaking, for CMM roles, I'd focus on your approach to developing content, how to set an editorial calendar, how to evaluate content performance.\n\nThose are the key things companies are looking for a CMM role. In my interviews, I haven't had companies ask me for examples of formal education. All they care about is what you've done in the real-world and how you can contribute to their needs.",
