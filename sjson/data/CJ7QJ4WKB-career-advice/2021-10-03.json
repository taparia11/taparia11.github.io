        "text": "Hey <@U025WLMJ60H> as someone who has been on both sides of the table, maybe I can provide some insight. The Carta resources <@U026R1895QV> suggested are really good and will help you evaluate the offering. Which brings me to my first point. How is the company managing the allocation? I’d be leary if they say they’ve got it all on a spreadsheet!\n\nAs an employee, I’d suggest viewing equity participation as icing on the cake and valuing it at $0 when comparing against an all cash (salary, bonus, benefits) offer. Here’s why:\n\n1. The value of your equity participation is just theoretical and depends on a liquify event to actualize the value that’s locked up.\n2. Liquidity events are extremely rare.\n3. Unless you’re a co-founder, your equity participation will be in the form of options and not shares. There is a major difference between the two. (Carta calls the equity grants but they’re really long-term options).\n4. In order to realize the full value of your equity participation there are a number of factors that need to align.\n5. You need to be fully vested. You earn the options over time (this is known as vesting) and during a liquidity event you typically only get the value of options that are vested.\n6. That liquidity event needs to price the shares above the strike\/preferred price of your options in order to realize any value.\n7. Options eventually expire, at which time their actual value becomes $0.\n8. If you leave the company before the liquidity event, your options are basically worthless. You typically have 90 days to convert those options to equity, but that requires you putting up some some cold hard cash and becoming a bonafide investor.\nYou need to consider the equity offer like an investor would:\n1. Because you’re dealing with options, vesting, cliffs, and strike price have an impact how quickly you can achieve the maximum theoretical value.\n2.  What’s the likelihood of a liquidity event occurring? (Does leadership have experience, a plan, etc.)\n3. Are you willing to stay with the company until a liquidity event occurs (if ever)? \n4. How likely is a liquidity event to occur during you employment? (Remember if you leave, your options are essentially worthless.\n5. What is their plan to trigger a liquidity event?\n6. Is that plan reasonable?\n7. What’s the anticipated value of the company at that point?\n8. What round of financing did they most recently complete? (Seed, Series A,B, etc.)\n9. How did the raises go? (Typically, the more rounds of financing, the less risk there is and the less equity participation you’ll receive).\nRemember when comparing against the market you need to establish what round of financing they’re at. Ultimately, comparing an offer that includes equity participation against one that doesn’t is like comparing apples to oranges, unless they both offer the equivalent in salary\/bonus\/benefits.",
