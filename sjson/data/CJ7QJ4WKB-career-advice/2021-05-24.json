        "text": "Hi <@U012UL77GUT> and thank you so much for your insight! It’s really helpful to get an understanding of the in-house perspective.\n\nMy pickle is that I work for a growth marketing agency so all of us are marketers–just different types. We have several content marketing specialists and strategists. Typically each specialist\/strategist has a handful of clients they work with and there’s usually a growth marketing specialist\/strategist on the client team with them.\n\nSo I’m trying to define those roles and create a career development path within an agency, which is a bit tough to do because there aren’t such segmented roles.",

Just want to make the right move and unsure how to proceed. \n\nI went through 3 interviews for a marketing content writer role, provided several long-form content samples and went through an assignment of editing and writing email, infographic anx landing page copy.\n\nI submitted a Venngage-based infographic \"mockup\" along with my copy and used the company's corporate colors to try and go the extra mile. I interviewed for a full time permanent role, and now they have posted a contract role for short-form content and occasional long-form.\n\nI submitted my test copy on Thursday, and they posted the contract role that same day. I am quite nervous seeing this temporary posting that maybe they are passing on my candidacy and trying for a contract person instead. They didn't tell me what they thought of my test assignment. Should I ask them about this new contract posting or just wait and see what comes of the permanent role interviews?\n\nThe discussions went well and they liked my long form samples. Just don't want to offer to work with them on a contract basis if I am still a viable candidate on a permanent basis. The contract role wasn't offered on their website or to me directly just a new posting on LinkedIn.\n\nIt has been a long weekend in Canada, and I am dreading possible bad news tomorrow.
