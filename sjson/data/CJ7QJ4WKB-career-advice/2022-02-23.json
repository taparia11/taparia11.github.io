With that, you can show them how much youâ€™re underpaid.

If you can, figure out what that role really isâ€¦at a minimum, I think that sounds like itâ€™s now a Content Marketing Manager or Content Lead role. With that, you can show them how much youâ€™re underpaid. IMHO if theyâ€™re not willing to give you a raise immediately, they should have a clear timeline for when youâ€™ll get a raise and title promotion (i.e., next performance review period)."
