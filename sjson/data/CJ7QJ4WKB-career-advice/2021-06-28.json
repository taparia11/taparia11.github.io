The title originally suggested was *Retention Marketing Manager*, then *Manager of Owned Media*. I think the role may be in line with a *Content Marketing Manager*, though.\n\nI have been working in a content marketing \/ content creation role, writing\/optimizing\/editing blog posts and doing SEO work, but my expertise spans across ecommerce marketing (I held a Digital Media Director role before this) and my strengths lie in strategy and content direction. Recently, my manager offered me a new, higher role as the company is restructuring its brand teams. This role would oversee all of our owned media channels including social, email, and the blog. I would be responsible for forming and implementing growth strategies as well as managing other content associates, customer service associates, and community managers. My manager offered me to choose my own title and I also need a title to do salary research as I believe their initial offer is too low (likely because the researched \"Retention Manager\" which is basically a customer service manager).\n\nIn the rapidly evolving world of ecommerce and digital marketing in general, there seems to be no consistency on titles.
