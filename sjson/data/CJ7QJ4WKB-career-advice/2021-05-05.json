This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: junior (1-3 years of experience)\n\n\"Dear Superpath,\n\nRecently, I experienced some pretty rapid and sudden career growth. I went from being a copywriter at an agency to an in-house campaigns lead at a rapidly-growing startup. It's a role I'd been chasing for a couple of years before I even landed the opportunity to interview for it.\n\nI've been here for about 6 months now, and while my coworkers and lead are great and the company is healthy in terms of the working environment, I'm still waiting to stop feeling like I'm not cut out for management work. \n \nThe truth is, I miss being an individual contributor. I get so much more satisfaction, pride and a sense of accomplishment from doing the deep work of SEO analysis, researching, interviewing, editing, writing and distribution than I do from crafting strategy and managing others. I dread conversations about further career growth because I can't shake off the conviction that I'm better cut out as an individual contributor. \n\nI guess my question is: has anyone found themselves in this spot? And what did you do about it? Did you take a step back into an IC role? Built up a freelancing gig? Sought coaching? \n\nThank you!\"",
