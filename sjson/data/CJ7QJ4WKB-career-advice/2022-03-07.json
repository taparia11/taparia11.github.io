(e.g. over-editing)\n• Rather than giving \"tasks\" all the time, try to assign \"objectives\". If your team knows what they're trying to achieve, they'll have more space for autonomy and creativity (which is what most marketers want). If you're just assigning tasks, your team will do what *they think you want* rather than *what they think is good*. \n• Recognize that there's no one-size-fits-all way to work with everyone. Every team member is going to require a totally different management style.\n• Give difficult feedback sooner rather than later. Especially with content roles, you can save so much time by ripping off the band-aid.\n• To add to what Brittany said, recognize that you're managing in both directions—to your team and to management. You have to be the strongest advocate for your team to management, but you also have to be the one to translate management-speak into things that will resonate with your team.\nJust a smattering of random advice.

When it’s paired with caring deeply, you’ll see so much growth in your team members with this approach, and likely hear that it motivates them as well because they know you’re investing in their growth.\n• Give yourself grace. “People issues” can be much more stressful than “work issues.” You will sometimes make mistakes in how you handled a situation with a team member, the same way we do with anything in life. Be patient with yourself as you grow this skill set and don’t beat yourself up—reflect on your learnings and use them to become a stronger manager in the future.\n• Talk to peers at your company and beyond. I have grown so much by building relationships with other managers in my organization and seeking out folks in Superpath that have similar roles to me. It is important to have people you trust who can be a sounding board for management challenges, outside of your reporting line. This will help you develop your own management style, as well as understand others’ approaches.\n• Last but not least, I would recommend everything Lara Hogan writes! She focuses on engineering management, but the principles of leadership are often universal. <https:\/\/larahogan.me\/blog\/manager-voltron\/|This article is a great start>—and I would add that you can build a “manager Voltron” (of people like I mentioned above) even if you have a wonderful + supportive manager.

One of the hardest things for me was shifting my mindset from being an individual contributor to a leader. As a leader, I found it important to remember that it’s not just about you anymore. Your success = the success of your team. :)\n\n3. Always give clear, constructive feedback. Come from a place of care, curiosity, and objectivity. Try to avoid giving “shit sandwiches”.\n\n4. Project management and people management are two different things! Allow yourself time to adjust to both.\n\n5. Be empathetic but protect your energy! :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nGood luck!",
