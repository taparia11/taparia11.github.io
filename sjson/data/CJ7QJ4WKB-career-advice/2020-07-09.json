The good news is that, within those core things I love there are several industries and \"roles\" that I could fit into. Industries like non-profit, education, healthcare, and even food &amp; beverage have stuck out to me and any roles related to branding, learning &amp; dev, editorial work, even customer experience have called to me. It's a fun journey!",
