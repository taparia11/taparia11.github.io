This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: mid (4-7 years of experience)\n\n\"In a sticky situation, where I moved from a product company to an agency to do SEO for them. I was promised I would be given clients from a certain niche. Instead I have been offloaded clients that came through referrals have 6 month long sales cycle, not achieved PMF &amp; looking to drive revenue from SEO. I personally don't think that SEO is the best channel for them. \n\nI have found myself hating to work for clients in the niche that I am not passionate about and are energy drainers for me. \nI am on the lookout to get few freelance clients in the niche I am interested in to keep myself happy.\n\nI am looking to have a tough conversation with my manager &amp; ask her to give me clients in the niche I was earlier promised. \n\nHow do I make a strong case for myself to offload these clients? \nI have data-points to back me up on why SEO isn't best for them at the moment.\n\nWhat options\/ scenarios could turn out from having this conversation? \n\nNote: Its been a short period since I joined them. I have shown results &amp; proved my point on why I am worth having the job in the agency so definitely not a sucker there. This has had me dissatisfied &amp; regretting my career move entirely at the moment.\n\nHow'd you suggest I go about solving this\n\n\"",
