One of my company's finance partners, BlueVine, published an interview that I did for their company newsletter.\n\nThis makes me happy because I haven't been doing many interview, speaking, or mentoring gigs over the last 3 years. I'm just now adventuring back into the \"real world.\"\n\nDuring this time of introspection, my perspectives have evolved considerably. I recently watched an interview that I did in 2016 and couldn't believe that person was \"me.\"\n\nThe biggest change is that I've completely lost my \"what's in it for me\" attitude. What I care more about these days is the opportunity to reach people, share things of value, and help facilitate more meaningful relationships.\n\nThat's why I'm doing interviews, speaking, and teaching again. I'm grateful that BlueVine gave me the opportunity to share my thoughts on the following:\n\n\"5 Ways to Embrace the Worst Part of Your Day.\"\n\nI hope my lessons learned (the hard way) are valuable to others in their own entrepreneurial, freelancing, and\/or small business journeys.\n\n<https:\/\/www.bluevine.com\/daily-business-challenges-solutions\/>",
