This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: mid (4-7 years of experience)\n\n\"Hey all! After a couple of years as a content marketing manager heading up a team of three, my manager (the CMO) has asked me to begin thinking about my career trajectory and which skills areas I see myself building upon.\n\nI've got SEO under my belt with a sprinkle of product, but I'm curious to hear from others about other specialisations\/channels that sit parallel to content and have been a great addition to their content tool kit.\n\nCurrently, I'm very much tied up in the weeds, so the plan is to take some of that away so I can focus more on strategy. But I'm a little stuck on the 'where to next?' bit. \n\nAs a side note, I'd love to hear from those who have been promoted from content marketing manager and what your next step was. What changed, and how did you get there? Doesn't even have to be in the realm of content — I've heard of people moving into digital product manager roles from content, so keen to hear more about those experiences also.\n\nThanks so much :)\"",
