As a startup marketer, I've worked most things out on my own, but I'm now looking for someone to provide both strategic and tactical advice, as well as just general career\/personal growth advice to help me grow on my journey.\n\nSo I have a couple of asks...\n\n1. Is any senior Marketing leader willing to either act as a mentor or be willing to refer me to someone who would be open to providing guidance?\n\n2. Does anyone know any tools or programs that have worked for themselves or someone they know to connect mentors and mentees?\n\n(FYI - I'm based out of Toronto, Ontario)",
