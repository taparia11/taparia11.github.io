        "text": "<@U034DAFBH5F> congrats on your new role! I’ll share some feedback as a fractional CMO and strategy marketing advisor\/ mentor.\n1. *Learn the business.* Meet with Sales, Product and Finance. How does the company make money? Which customer segments and products are the most profitable? How do they measure success? Know the business goals and always keep these top of mind. Build your content strategy and plan with this in mind. Trust me, the CEO and CFO only want to know how your efforts contribute to business growth.\n2. *Learn about your customers.* Where does customer intelligence come from at the company? Too many startups rely on ‘gut instinct’ or believing that they are the customer, which leads to mediocre content and marketing. Has the value prop been validated\/ tested? Can you talk directly to customers? or hire someone to conduct customer interviews? Nothing gets you a seat at the table quicker than being the voice of the customer. (And while keyword research is one piece of the puzzle, it’s a tiny sliver of the big picture).\n3. *Suggest experiments\/ pilot projects.* You bring a unique perspective coming from outside the industry - use that to your advantage! Plant the seed early that you don’t want to follow a cookie cutter approach. Suggest experimentation as part of the plan. Many marketers fall into the trap of becoming order takers because they don’t sell their vision\/ philosophy. \n4. *Internal marketing.* It’s not often discussed, but a key skill for marketers is the ability to create buy-in. Without it, you will fight a daily uphill battle. As others have suggested, this is so much easier when you’ve taken time to build relationships with your stakeholders. Figure out who these people are, meet with them to “interview” them on their ideas\/ perspectives, etc, involve them in your projects, and share updates on how things are working. \n5. Regarding the CMO comment — I suggest taking ownership of your job description - where it starts and ends. I have met with many CEO’s and they don’t understand all of the different areas of marketing (strategy, content, events, branding, sales enablement, PR, social media, website - to them it’s all “marketing”). So a good place to start is to make sure you’re both aligned on what your job is. Have a candid conversation with the CEO and ask them how you should address things that fall outside of your wheelhouse.  If it’s like most startups, you’ll be wearing a lot of hats and duct taping things together until you get more resources. :)",
