This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: junior (1-3 years of experience)\n\n\"Hey folks, I have been doing freelance writing for the past 2.5-3 years. Prior to that I have wet my feet into various forms of marketing (Jack of all trades).\n\nNow, here is the conundrum I am facing. As much as I enjoy content marketing, I just don't feel like writing. There are just far too many writers who are better at the craft than me. I would genuinely enjoy working on content strategy, analysis, ideating new content properties, etc. Are there any roles in content marketing that would allow me to work on these things with minimal content writing?\n\nThank you!\"",
