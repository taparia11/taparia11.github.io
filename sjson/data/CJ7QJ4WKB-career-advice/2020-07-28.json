Over the last few months we’ve gone through a massive layoff which has left me as a team of one leading marketing. I’m currently in a position where I’m trying to figure out what *I want* moving forward when we get to a point of rebuilding our team (Ideally end of year, but TBD of course).\n\nWhat I’m going back and forth on is what I want to push for when it comes time to hire:\n1. Hiring a senior leader who will ultimately have deeper knowledge on how to grow the marketing arm\/business. I’ll ultimately report to this person and ideally learn a lot from them as a result.\n2. Building out my own team. Starting my people-management journey and free up some time to really be able to push for business growth myself.\nI’m super proud of what I’ve been able to accomplish on my own these past few months, but sometimes doubt creeps in and I question my abilities to really skyrocket growth, let alone mentor someone to be an awesome marketer.\n\nObviously at the end of the day, we’ll do what’s best for the business… But if you’ve ever been in a similar position… I’d love to chat!",
