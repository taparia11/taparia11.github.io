This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: mid (4-7 years of experience)\n\n\"Hey, everyone. I was promoted to a managerial role just a few months ago and I'm about to have a difficult conversation with one of my juniors, I'd love it if you can offer me some advice. Here's the situation. Our boss bought us a subscription to an AI writing assistant and some of our writers have started using it excessively to the extent they use the tool to generate entire articles. One of my best writers has fallen into this rut. We hired her because she was a good researcher who is capable of digging deep into a topic to draft comprehensive content, but right now the articles she turns in are pretty shallow and frankly copycat content. I wanna talk to her and address this without breaking the relationship I have built with her over the past few months. I would love to hear your thoughts on how I should proceed.\"",
