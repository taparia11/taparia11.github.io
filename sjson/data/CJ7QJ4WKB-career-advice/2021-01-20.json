But your bosses or clients _don’t care about any of that._ \n\nThey don’t (usually) care if it’s a podcast, a book, or a blog post → these are TACTICS. What they expect to hear is how any content you produce will solve a business challenge → this is STRATEGY.\n\n…and you make yourself way more employable and valuable (think: $) if you move from ‘just’ delivering like a tactician to also thinking like a strategist. Instead of jumping straight into a tactic (“we should have a blog!” or “let’s get on Clubhouse!“), thinking like a strategist requires you to first understand what’s going on and determine where you want to go. And that usually happens when you start *asking the right questions in the right order*.\n\nI made the slide deck below to show you what I mean &amp; the kinds of questions you can start asking + *<https:\/\/contentfolks.substack.com\/p\/content-marketing-diagnosis-strategy-tactics|here is some more context>* if you want the behind-the-scenes story of how I learned this lesson.\n\nHope this gets you a promotion or raise some time soon! :wink:",
