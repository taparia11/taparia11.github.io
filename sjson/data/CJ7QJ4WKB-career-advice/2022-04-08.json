I got a lot of good advice, which I am working on, but I have another question. My portfolio is on Dribbble and is primarily print-based, and I have a lot of infographics, among other samples, posted from the two newspapers where I worked. To build up a more content-oriented portfolio, can anyone suggest some projects I might take on to add to my collection of infographics? I am not entirely sure where to start in terms of the kinds of projects, but I would also like to know if it's acceptable to include self-guided ones. I would think that volunteer projects would be OK in any case. I appreciate your thoughts and ideas on this. Thanks!",
