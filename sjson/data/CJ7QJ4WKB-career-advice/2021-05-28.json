Getting clients can be very challenging and I won’t begin to try and understand how much harder it is for yourself in a developing country. I think it’s commendable that you’ve been grinding this out despite your current challenges. \n\nI agree with everything <@U01GLCVCT89> said. It’s very practical and something I should even do. I’d caution to be very wise in how you tell clients about your experience and skills. Highlight your skills don’t open with “I’m not the best writer.”\n\nAdditionally, I’ll offer up a resource that may help you. I used to work at Acadium which connects people that want marketing experience with marketing professionals and business owners. You do what’s called an apprenticeship for three months with a mentor of your choosing. Signing up for Acadium as an apprentice led to 3 freelance clients and even a contract with company itself. \n\nI’d encourage you to try it in order to get more experience writing in English. Create a really clear and well written profile and they’ll accept you into the marketplace. I hope this helps!",
