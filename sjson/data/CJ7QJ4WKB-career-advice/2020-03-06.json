One that's remote with a company that sells a framework for developing mobile apps, and two based in NYC. One company is a more established biz that sells video player software, and the other is a newer biz that sells a content intelligence platform. This is obviously a very tough decision, so I was hoping to hear from some of you fine folks about how you've made tough job decisions in the past. What factors do you consider? Your guidance is appreciated!",
