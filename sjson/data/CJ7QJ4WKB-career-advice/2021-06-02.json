I do some freelance writing for clients but am thinking I need to be full time to really grow my skills and experience. I am curious from practicing content writers out there and managers who hire writers — what do strong resumes for writing positions look like? Do you recommend having a portfolio? If you are a writer or someone who hires writers can you share examples of strong resumes and portfolios? Thanks much! ",
