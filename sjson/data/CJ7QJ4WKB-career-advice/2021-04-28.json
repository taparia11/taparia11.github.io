This is a way for folks to ask anonyous questions. \n\nCareer stage: mid (4-7 years of experience)\n\n\"I've been having a bit of a crisis moment for the last year or so and would love to hear thoughts from fellow content marketers! I've been beaten down with toxic culture after toxic culture. When it comes down to it, I really love writing, but my bad experiences are starting to put a bad taste in my mouth and not make it fun anymore. I'm thinking about taking a bit of a break, a few months off to reevaluate what I want to do for a career and take care of my mental and physical health.... but I'm worried there either won't be opportunities\/companies in content marketing that will understand my break, or I won't be able to start something totally new because of lack of experience. Thoughts? Tell it to me straight!\"",
