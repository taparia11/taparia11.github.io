This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: junior (1-3 years of experience)\n\n\"Portfolio question for everyone! I'm an agency copywriter and a big chunk of my job is writing guest posts for our clients. Since the published articles are under a different name (we use personas, which I'm not too happy about coming from a journalism background but oh well) so I can't put those articles on my website portfolio as writing examples. \n\nI've written a ton of articles on high DR sites and want to show them off, but not sure what the right way to approach this problem. Any thoughts on how to highlight guest posts you've written but it shows a different byline? \"",
