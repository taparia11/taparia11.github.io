I was running content at my last company and when I came back from a mat leave, there was a lot of product marketing work to be done because the company was a) launching a new sub-brand and b) launching a subscription product, as opposed to only offering one-off products. So I decided to make the switch and try it out, focusing on launches, positioning, customer research, educational content, and pricing\/packaging optimization. I took the PMA Core certification, which was great, and then recently made the switch to another product marketing role (though there's still a lot of content work involved, as there are no content marketers here yet!). Happy to chat through how I made the switch. I still think there's a huge overlap between content + product marketing, especially at earlier-stage companies, so you can do product marketing while still having a big hand in content.",

I was running content at my last company and when I came back from a mat leave, there was a lot of product marketing work to be done because the company was a) launching a new sub-brand and b) launching a subscription product, as opposed to only offering one-off products. So I decided to make the switch and try it out, focusing on launches, positioning, customer research, educational content, and pricing\/packaging optimization. I took the PMA Core certification, which was great, and then recently made the switch to another product marketing role (though there's still a lot of content work involved, as there are no content marketers here yet!). Happy to chat through how I made the switch. I still think there's a huge overlap between content + product marketing, especially at earlier-stage companies, so you can do product marketing while still having a big hand in content."
