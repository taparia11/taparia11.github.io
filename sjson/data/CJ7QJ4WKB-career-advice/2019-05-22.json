I’ve transitioned to a three person microteam that includes me, our Content Strategist\/Managing Editor, and Content Marketing Specialist. My responsiblilities are the project management of campaigns, amplifying\/promoting our content, technical aspects (SEO\/keyword\/audience research\/etc.), and tactical implementation with our CRM and tools, as well as ongoing testing, optimization, and working with our other teams to make sure our systems are running smoothly with one another. I write very sparingly because my time is focused on all of the other management efforts. I’m also curious if other people hold this type of role because I’m always looking for ways to develop in it, or the title of the position in general.",
