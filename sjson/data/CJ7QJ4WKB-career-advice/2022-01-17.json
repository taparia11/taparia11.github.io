Not to blow my own toot, but based on my Manager’s feedback (who also happens to be the CMO and the Co-founder) it seems that I have checked all the boxes and the management is really happy with what I have achieved. \n\nThe issue is that a LOT has changed since I have joined wrt to the scope of work and handling responsibilities. For example:  \n\n• I’m single handedly responsible for not just overall content marketing, but also website SEO management, digital PR as well as social media. In my last role these were three separate positions. The company had a relationship with an external PR agency but not anymore, so this tells me that there’s budget. \n• My role has evolved into a team management role where I manage one internal employee and have been provided budget to work with other freelancers. \nGiven the scenario I’m tempted to ask for more $$$ (the original plan was to bump my CTC by $5000 on successful completion of probation) but that doesn’t seem to justify the pay for the amount of work there is.\n\nI’m also keen on realigning my designation which seems to be the case for others in my team. How do I approach this while not sounding like a douchebag? I really like working here, am not looking out, but the thought that others around me are getting paid more and have a better designation for almost the same amount of work demotivates me.\n\nThanks for reading! Looking forward to your feedback :woman-cartwheeling::skin-tone-5:",
