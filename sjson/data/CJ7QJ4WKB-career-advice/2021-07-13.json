I feel like there's no visually appealing way to organize written work on a website. I'm also frustrated with the cost of websites, as it feels like a waste of money when I'm not actively job hunting. A couple writers in a Facebook group I'm in said they simply use a folder on Google Drive and share that with potential clients and it has worked out well for them. Another suggested just adding those pieces to my LinkedIn profile.\n\nWhat would you all suggest? I'm open to jobs in both SEO and traditional advertising, so I'd like to highlight both types of work. For the SEO content, I'd also like to include performance metrics as well. I'm not sure what the best way to organize all that would be. Any advice would be appreciated. I'd especially love to hear from anyone who hires creatives to get your perspective on how you'd feel about getting a Google Drive link for a portfolio rather than a link to a website.",

This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: mid (4-7 years of experience)\n\n\"Hey everyone,\n\nI work at an agency in a mid-senior role. Since starting at the agency, I've gone above and beyond. These efforts didn't go unnoticed and I received excellent feedback from colleagues across the agency. I've achieved some of the top results for campaigns to date, developed all the department processes, and regularly provide consulting to clients alongside the Directors and VPs. I was promised a promotion to a senior position in my next annual review this July. (I think you know where this is going.)\n\nDue to a recent and poorly-communicated change in the system, anyone who was hired after January 1, 2020 has had their annual reviews moved to next January. I was hired on January 6. I will now have only an \"informal chat\" this year and the promotion (or any raise) is off the table. Meanwhile, everyone else in my department is still getting annual reviews (and all of them received promotions and raises). I'm happy for them, since it's not a race, but I can't help feeling undervalued. I'd also be annoyed if this had happened to anyone else.\n\nIs this the kind of red flag that can't be ignored? Or should I tough it out and keep my fingers crossed for January? I appreciate your thoughts!\"",
