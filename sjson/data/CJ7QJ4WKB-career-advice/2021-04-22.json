This is a way for folks to ask anonyous questions. \n\nCareer stage: junior (1-3 years of experience)\n\n\"Seeking interview advice for someone with a non-traditional background.\n\nI've taken a very non-traditional path with my career. No college degree (Ivy League dropout if that means anything), spent most of my twenties traveling and working in restaurants. Didn't become career-focused until 30, but have taken it very seriously since (34 now). Taught myself SEO, copywriting, web design, and social media marketing all pretty darn well! I've got a dozen live projects throughout the web I can show as proof of skill set and self-motivation. \n\nI've gussied up my resume, linkedin, and public profiles to highlight my projects and skills, and often have no problem getting -to- the initial interview, but inevitably that's when they want to know my background and start to see red flags. \n\nPerhaps this is my own insecurity, but I feel the lack of a degree and very little white collar work experience (despite being 34) really throws people off. \n\nI'm very confident I've got what it takes to help a great company. How can I help them get past their biases to give me a chance? \n\nThanks for your time. Grateful I could post this anonymously because I'm dealing with serious imposter syndrome in these professional groups!\"",
