This is a way for folks to ask anonymous questions. \n\nCareer stage: junior (1-3 years of experience)\n\n\":rotating_light:Freelance copywriter rates question!!! A recruiter for a freelance jr CW position reached out and asked for my rates. And I have no idea what to say back. There are tons of resources out about freelance rate negotiation, but few actually give out real numbers and don't take into account experience and project type. \n\nIf I have a few years of writing under my belt and the position is a set number of hours per week (either 20 or 40), should I base rate on hours, day, or project? And what $ range would you suggest I say to the recruiter? I know it all depends on the projects, but any tips here that won't scare the recruiter are probably way better than anything I've found online so far haha. \"",
