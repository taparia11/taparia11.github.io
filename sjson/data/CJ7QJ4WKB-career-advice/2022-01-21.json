I think what she meant was that often undervalue ourselves or don’t feel worthy asking for what we deserve. This advice helped me a lot when I was freelancing. \nFor taxes, I’d consult a good CPA right away. I had to do the same to figure out if I should be a sole proprietor or get incorporated. Just talking to the CPA took away a lot of my anxiety. \nAs for setting yourself up for success and turning it into a full time job, I’d say just continue to do your best work, and the rest will follow. Good luck :raised_hands:",
