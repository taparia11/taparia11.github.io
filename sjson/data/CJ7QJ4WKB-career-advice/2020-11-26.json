Some companies combine content\/product marketing which is where the upper bounds comes in.\n\nRight now I'm at eBay - not a FAANG, but I'd say the compensation and work dynamics are similar to Airbnb.  At both companies (at least in my teams) you're expected to be the go-to expert on one area and you're expected to stay in your lane.\n\nCompensation tends to be higher at larger companies but you have to deal with bureaucracy (all my content is reviewed by dozens of team members plus legal), and there isn't much room to branch out into other specialties.\n\nFor me, I'm happy with this arrangement because there's always something new. I interface with 80+ people across 17 markets globally so there's no time for me to go outside my role.\n\nAll that in mind - I'd say many later stage startups (Series B onwards) also come close to FAANG compensation for marketing.\n\nI'd say engineering or technical roles are the ones where you see an extreme bump in compensation. For marketing - the main perks are the brand, networking, and pretty cool offices (at least for Airbnb).",
