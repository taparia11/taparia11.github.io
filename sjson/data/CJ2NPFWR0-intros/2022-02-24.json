I’m John Doherty, founder and CEO at <http:\/\/GetCredo.com|GetCredo.com> and <http:\/\/EditorNinja.com|EditorNinja.com> plus a few other random brands around the internet. I split my time between Denver and Breckenridge Colorado with my wife, daughter, and dog.\n\nI was a professional SEO for a long time, working at 2 agencies (notably Distilled) and then in-house for Zillow on two of their brands. I went out on my own in 2015 to self-fund Credo with my own SEO consulting, which I stopped in 2018.\n\nRecently started <http:\/\/EditorNinja.com|EditorNinja.com> so I’m focused on growing that, while keeping Credo going strong as well. My balance is mountain therapy as often as I can get it, where I love skiing, mountain biking, and hiking depending on the season. I’m also a big bourbon fan, though I won’t often say no to an IPA (though I’m currently doing a shortened timeline version of 75hard).",
