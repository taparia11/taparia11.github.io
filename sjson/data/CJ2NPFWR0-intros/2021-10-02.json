I started this freelance journey full time last year during the pandemic when I frankly couldn't just sit around and collect unemployment so I jumped into freelancing full time. Before then I was a communications strategist for the IT security department at a large company. Currently I write for multiple published websites as a featured writer and ghost write for several small businesses and blogs. I am looking forward to connecting with others in the industry and grow my network of opportunities. My DM is always open if you would like to discuss opportunities with working with me.",
