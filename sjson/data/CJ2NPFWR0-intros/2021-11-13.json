I'm Ebi, a Content Strategist at the Singapore-based agency <http:\/\/withcontent.co|With Content>  We call ourselves a content marketing agency, but recently I've been wondering how well that term applies since so much of our work is limited to production (i.e., we rarely get to look into clients' backends\/GA to see results and create better content). Right now, I'm trying to figure out how we can improve our processes, more clearly define our direction, and learn from highly talented content marketers to improve my writing craft.\n\nI'm actually from Indonesia, so if you have questions about vacationing here or great places to visit, feel free to ask away :slightly_smiling_face: I'd also be more than happy to connect on <https:\/\/linkedin.com\/in\/ebi|LinkedIn>!",
