I'm Alastair and recently switched my focus from launching a startup to looking to work full-time in venture capital (you guessed right its coz of Covid). I've recently got an internship with an Indian-focussed VC fund. What I also do in my downtime is help with presentation work (pro bono). This is because I get to work with exciting ideas and also understand businesses which I think pays for itself in a way. Here's a link to my presentation work - <http:\/\/alastairpavrey.com\/portfolio\/presentation-portfolio\/>\n\nIf any startup founder or someone building a cool idea (particularly consumer, fintech or esports) is looking for some help do DM me here. Look forward :)",
