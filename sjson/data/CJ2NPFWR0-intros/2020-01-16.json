I’m a freelance writer\/marketer (shameless plug - if anyone needs some writing - I’d love to connect!). I started my career in media, working as a news producer for an iHeartMedia radio station and then as a digital journalist covering the NBA. I made the shift into marketing when I took a gig as a content specialist for a hospitality company based in Las Vegas. \n\nIf I’ve piqued your interest, you can learn more about me by visiting my personal website. I have writing samples on there, too. :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n<https:\/\/santiagos.space|https:\/\/santiagos.space>",
