        "text": "Hi everyone! Thank you <@UJG9WTEKG> and <@UJ48Q1HAP> for welcoming me into this group. I've been looking for a community like this one for a long time and have clearly been missing out on an amazing secret.\n\nA little about me: I'm a teacher and writer at heart. I've been a content marketer, UX researcher, and data scientist hybrid, and found myself in the realm of \"tech\" in all of its shapes and forms. I am passionate about making complex topics more human, relatable, and fun.\n\nIn 2014, I started an agency called Storyhackers. We worked with high-growth SaaS companies, public companies, and government innovation\/infrastructure projects all over the world. I've worked across many sectors -- healthcare, financial services, SaaS, IoT, IT, security, to name a few-- and have also been in functions related to research, product development, technical project management, and design.\n\nIn 2019, we shut down the agency to turn the Storyhackers brand into a software and education company. I'm still a co-founder and will return to the team eventually. In the meantime, I'm back to my freelancing roots under my alter-ego \"Ritikamonster.\" My mission is to facilitate the sharing of knowledge in support of the U.N. Sustainable Development goals. Ritikamonster writes and also makes educational videos, presentation decks, (and comics!) :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nI joined this group for a few reasons:\n\n• I'm looking to meet and form strong connections with chill, smart, people who appreciate the craft of business writing.\n• Seeking and locking down projects as a freelancer requires serious hustle! I love to keep my eyes peeled for projects that will further my ability to learn and grow as a human\n• I've always wanted a community like this one to exist!\n• I live in San Francisco and love to meet people both here and out of the area to expand my worldview.\n\nI look forward to meeting all of you. If anyone happens to be seeking freelance writing, video, presentation, or report creation muscle, I'm here. Also DM me if you want to talk, share content, or generally goofball :slightly_smiling_face:",
