I work both with well-established clients trying to increase their revenue and with an accelerator program for entrepreneurs. I'm very good at long-term projects aiming to increase the online visibility of my clients, and building verticals through connecting them, when possible. \n\nCurrently, my clients are in Latin America &amp; US, but I'm trying to replicate my strategy in Central Europe, focusing on the possibility of entrepreneurs exporting their goods or services to other European countries or other markets. \n\nI speak 6 languages and I'm very well-connected with people in different locations, in order to target local markets with a unique strategy. I also work with a team of 12 talented people, from web developers to designers or video editing professionals. \n\nIf I can help you in any way, please feel free to contact me!
