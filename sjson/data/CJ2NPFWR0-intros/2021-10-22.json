        "text": "Hi, everyone. I'm Adam Baer, a disabled writer and editor, who also works as an editorial + multimedia consultant\/strategist. I've been an NPR producer and editor who also wrote web copy; a New Republic columnist who covered digital concerts; a Slate Summary Judgment writer who also contributed Culturebox essays; a NYT tech writer; a top editor of a tremendous digital mag that was profiled in the NYT Magazine; Travel + Leisure's first tech correspondent; and a music critic, who has contributed to Rolling Stone, The New Yorker, Wired, GQ, Harper's, Bon Appetit, The Atlantic, etc. I've also written for a lot of other Conde, Time Inc., and Hearst-type magazines, as well as funny ad-copy-style blurbs about tons of products. Additionally, I serve as a private writing\/media-making coach\/editor. Most recently I was an Inc. contributing editor, and I've written branded content and advertising copy for Sony Music, Epsilon, McMurry, Pace, Story Worldwide, Lexus, Gilt, TBWA, Ritz Carlton, Fedex, IBM, the co. that made yr phone, and many others. My site is <http:\/\/adambaer.com|adambaer.com>, and I'm on <https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/baeradam\/|LinkedIn>, too. I'm really community oriented--my last podcast, Recoup, was about uncertainty, chronic illness, wellness, and loneliness. I love to work on teams, even if i'm leading them. I'd love to meet more people in our field and collaborate. Thank you for reading this megillah!",
