Like many content folks, I got my start in journalism and then pivoted to digital content marketing for tech. I’m currently a content strategist in the design tool space. Areas I’m particularly interested in right now are building out a content program and tapping into user communities. Some personal interests include brewing strong coffee, B sci-fi in all its forms, yoga and, recently, spinning.",
