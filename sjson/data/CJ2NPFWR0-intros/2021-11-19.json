I've discovered that I prefer the writing aspect and am aiming professionally to get into Content Management Strategies. In fact, I did this for two years at a company, but it was so basic, and I've learned a helluva lot more about SEO and better practices since.\n\nI've got my own gig going, Bloss Words, but I don't get leads from my website--if it still exists. I'm mainly networking on <https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/donna-gleize-bloss-73469325\/|LinkedIn> but hope to broaden in other communities like this one here!\n\nThanks for welcoming me, and feel free to reach out at any time about anything - although I may not reply due to timezone and the fact that my smartphone is too old to support Slack :confused:",
