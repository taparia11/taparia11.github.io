I came into content marketing following college education in journalism. In grad school, I got my master’s in journalism with a specialty in documentary film and when I finished in 2008, I had a harsh welcome to the professional world during a recession. Nothing is more deflating than taking a role at a job that isnt your background but I was able to reinvent my resume to be editorial-focused and started a series of content roles at startups in the Bay Area including Zinio, Scribd and Evernote. \n\nI have truly enjoyed a career in content and have learned a lot about how impactful storytelling can help attract and engage consumers, but also excite employees as well. I believe everyone has a remarkable story and that all of us here in this group have the ability to do great things with an art of storytelling that has been around for centuries. The magic is when we get that realization. Happy to be here and happy to connect with and collaborate!",
