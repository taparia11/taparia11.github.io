I am in Denver, and not sure I could afford it now had I not been here early on. Many folks have moved outside the city to find a little less pricey places to live. CoSprings, FortCollins (less so), Denver, Golden, Boulder are all going to be high people counts and relative high costs.\n\nMy biz partner grew up in Fort Collins and goes back there frequently to be with her parents. Cost of living is not as high as Denver area, but it's a college town and prices are higher than other areas.\n\nIf you want to be in the mountains where it's more remote - Gunnison is amazing (my sister\/fam live there) - it's near Crested Butte &amp; Monarch - so great skiing and so much outdoor stuff to do there. I do have to mention it gets REALLY cold there (one of the coldest places in the country), but people deal. On the flip side it is fantastic in the summer.\n\nBuena Vista is also very beautiful and in the mountains - it is getting more built up, but very small town. I have a friend who lives there and I am sure would love to talk about it if you want a locals scoop (same with my sis in Gunnison).",
