Check which, if any, articles on the SERP feel like the right fit\n3. Run them through Ahrefs\n4. Look at organic keywords that get the most traffic for multiple articles, if possible (Pro tip: sometimes, a really high-quality site will help you along by making their slug the keyword they found to be the best version)\n5. If nothing fits, try another stream of consciousness version of my topic\n6. Repeat steps 2-4 until I find the best 1-3 keywords to target\n7. Google the keywords I like to double-check that the intent of the currently top-ranking articles matches the intent of what I want to write about\nIn this case, I just did my process and came up with two options.\n\nThe first, if you're talking about how to create better content that will perform for search, gave me 3 decent keywords that can be covered in the same resource:\n• SEO writing [2900\/mo, 42 KD]\n• SEO content writing [1100\/mo, 55 KD]\n• blog SEO [800\/mo, 75 KD]\nThe second, if you're specifically targeting how to refresh aging content to improve its ranking, gave me these:\n• old blog [40\/mo, 25 KD]\n• republishing content [20\/mo, 37 KD]\nObviously, the second is a far less search-heavy keyword, but if it's what you're talking about, it's a more relevant target.\n\n(Also, this probably doesn't answer your original question but is just the way I try to figure this out myself. If I were just saying out loud how I'd describe it, I would probably say \"how to refresh old blog posts\" or \"how to improve SEO for an old blog post\". That's probably why \"old blog\" was actually the most relevant KW I could find!)",
