The things that I find most helpful are: 1) listening to the exec speak about the thought leadership topic, whether that’s in a live interview , a voice memo, or as a recorded Zoom session with 2-3 stakeholders discussing the topic; 2) seeing successful examples of the exec’s thought leadership content. For 1), it helps me to hear them talk about the topic in a conversational way—how they use industry lingo, what verbs and adjectives they repeat, what specific examples they speak to to support their ideas, and how they inject humor or lightheartedness into a serious topic. For 2), it helps me understand what the exec is shooting for. Sometimes the voice they want to convey in written thought leadership isn’t actually all that similar to how they talk—which IMHO isn’t a good thing, but when you’re ghostwriting, sometimes you just need to make the client happy. And sometimes that means making them sound smarter, more articulate, or more inspired than they sound in person. (In this scenario, if the exec doesn’t have any examples of thought leadership that they’re already happy with, having them share 2-3 examples from different writers whose voice they admire or want to emulate can also help get you there.) For me, the combination of conversational recording and written examples helps me get to a place where execs are happy with the results, feel well-represented, and are proud to publish much faster.
