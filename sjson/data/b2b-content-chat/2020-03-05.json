Unlike <@URAV154AV>, I do think there’s a useful distinction between sales content and marketing content, and I’m still struggling to define it. A few important points.\n\nI think sales content is sometimes created for ‘backstage’ use and isn’t intended for customers or prospects to see it. (Examples: playbooks, battle cards, and other sales enablement materials.) I can't think of any marketing content that's created with no intention of sharing it with external audiences. Maybe you can help me here.\n\nSales content is often created for cold outreach (sales prospecting). For cold outreach, it's most effective NOT to look or sound like marketing.\n\nIn contrast, marketing content is usually created for inbound marketing or for nurturing of people who have expressed interest. This is entirely different from content for cold outreach.\n\nFinally, sales content often works best if it's designed for one-to-one use, not for one-to-many. That’s because salespeople almost always work one to one with their accounts and their contacts.  They're usually looking for ways to personalize their messaging.\n\nIn contrast, marketers often work one to many. They're usually trying to find ways to scale their content across many accounts.\n\nI agree with Cassandra that this channel name was a little off. Maybe a more useful channel name here would be B2B Complex Sales or SaaS Enterprise Sales.\n\nThat’s a truly important and interesting distinction, because SaaS enterprise sales are very different than B2B SaaS transactional sales or product-led growth (PLG). Transactional sales require only low involvement of a salesperson, and PLG sales often require none.\n\nEnterprise sales require huge involvement of salespeople. The target markets are usually smaller. The decision process is longer and more complex. Prospects have more questions to answer. More business units or business functions participate in the decision. Risk is a much bigger factor. And on and on. So enterprise sales are entirely different for all these reasons and more.",
