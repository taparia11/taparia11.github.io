You could look at some successful competitor blogs and might be able to pull some numbers on how long it took them to get to that point (years). Once you get some traction, one metric that always helped me as a blog manager was site entrances through our blogs. Once filtered for this, I could provide good metrics on what how our readers were engaging with the content and other parts of the website.",

You could look at some successful competitor blogs and might be able to pull some numbers on how long it took them to get to that point (years). Once you get some traction, one metric that always helped me as a blog manager was site entrances through our blogs. Once filtered for this, I could provide good metrics on what how our readers were engaging with the content and other parts of the website."
