One of them says “If I am spending 2 minutes on a chaser email, then adding 10 minutes hunting down a blog is too much time-cost. Though if there were a set of 10 “go-to” articles I could just template up an email to go with them.”",

Though if there were a set of 10 “go-to” articles I could just template up an email to go with them.”"
