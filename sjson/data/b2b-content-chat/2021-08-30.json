If you could name  one person of interest who should be on this show, who would it be?\" and then ask for contact.\n\nAlso I find it really important to carve our a unique aspect of your podcast. Talking to other people? Already being done. With no edits? Ah... maybe that's something. Some other ideas:\n• Think of one questions you will ask every guest (makes an awesome long-tail content opportunity!)\n• Ask questions that have not been asked before (favorite ice cream flavour? AHA moment of the last book they read? Role models? Life goals? If you could relive your life, what would you do differently? etc.)\n• Combine your own show with being a guest on others yourself and try to interrelate. That's a massive virality potential and is attractive for guests and potential hosts to speak with you.\nJust my 2 cents. Hope that helps!",
