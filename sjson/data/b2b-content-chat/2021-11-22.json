A lot of times, that audit will start to reveal ways your company can stand out and compete on more than just product-focused content. I personally think the best way to create content that stands out and is super useful to your target audience is by interviewing the folks building the product. I've always found that getting them to share who they are, what they do, and why they're building what they're building leads to amazing content!",

Does it all feel similar to your audience? A lot of times, that audit will start to reveal ways your company can stand out and compete on more than just product-focused content. I personally think the best way to create content that stands out and is super useful to your target audience is by interviewing the folks building the product. I've always found that getting them to share who they are, what they do, and why they're building what they're building leads to amazing content!"
