The goal was to get new leads through form fills (or at least get them to wander around the website) but it wasn't successful - didn't get many click-throughs or leads generated and thus didn't justify anything close to the price. Next time we'd be much more rigorous with scoping out sponsors - asking more about their audience size and engagement, historical performance, etc. In my experience, industry newsletters don't have a great rep - at least the large ones with over, say, 80k subscribers - as the audience quality tends to diminish fast.",
