(content team size: 2\/3 folks + a freelancer, so keep that into account)\n\n• We’re getting to a place where content success is measured in its ability to _influence or even directly drive business results_ that are meaningful to us (this could be sign ups, expansions, revenue, customer satisfaction scores, etc.). Organic traffic is a nice-to-have, but we’d rather have lower and very targeted traffic than masses of people who are never going to use our (very technical, and probably a bit niche) product.  \n• We both publish articles and refresh existing ones, but overall we’re not focused on cadence—sometimes a blog post takes a week, sometimes a guide takes three. We take a “when it’s ready and we’re happy, it’s out” approach, though if you were to look for trends you’d probably see two, three long-form things overall in any given month (including a newsletter).  \n• Targeting-wise, we’re running JTBD interviews to better understand our customers’ relationship to content—ours, and other people’s. You can draw false conclusions about what works and doesn’t when you only focus on what you _are_ doing—but there is always stuff you are _not_ doing that could potentially work even better if you were to do it (podcasts, reddit threads, professional communities, etc., who knows?). So generally, before thinking about and investing into specific formats, we’d like to gather some data…\n    ◦ …with the caveat that sometimes we do stuff _just because we believe in it_ and\/or we want to do something nice. Like <https:\/\/postmarkapp.com\/postmark-express|this here comic book>: I guarantee no customer ever said they wanted or needed it… but they’re going to be delighted when they find out it exists! One of our recent marketing KPIs is “spreading joy with content,” so… :wink: ",
