I’m sure big companies just buy the production of these reports by fostering Market Research companies but how do you go about producing these reports with more startup-friendly budget? I’m aware that they are services where you can outsource data collection (i.e. <https:\/\/askwonder.com\/|AskWonder>) but eager to hear your processes and recommendation. Feel free to drop your data report\/whitepaper as well!\n\nIn my case, we’ll definitely need public data - for example - job demands in particular sector, or price ranges \/ salary growth for that sectors etc.",

                "text": "Over the past three years, I've helped B2B SaaS clients drive MILLIONS of dollars in revenue by creating the kind of research reports people actually want to read and share. Like the 2020 Remote Work Report, which has driven $680k in revenue (so far). Now I'm packing EVERYTHING I know about research report creation and distribution into a course that includes my plug-and-play TEMPLATE. I also answer all your burning questions: How do I come up with a compelling storyline? How do I get valid data? What if the data doesn't support the story I want to tell? Am I supposed to gate the report for lead gen? How do I project manage all the moving parts? Why is my butt itchy? (Well on second thought, not ALL your burning questions.) If you know me from my LinkedIn posts, you know my content has an edge to it. So expect some sarcasm, and maybe a swear or two. And expect to walk away with the knowledge and confidence you need to start creating your own research reports. (Scroll down for testimonials, a course preview, FAQs, and an about me.)

In-house B2B marketers and writers who want to produce bigger business results, hit their numbers, impress their bosses, and get promoted. 2. Experienced freelance content writers and marketing agency owners who want to earn more money by adding a high-ticket item to their services menu. Who's this course NOT for?This is an advanced content marketing course. If you don't understand basic content marketing acronyms and tactics, this course will go over your head. You should also have strong writing skills—or an experienced writer you can assign work to. What will I learn in this course?You’ll learn a step-by-step process for project managing, creating, and distributing marketing research reports. The B2B SaaS companies I work with use reports to build thought leadership; support SEO and PR initiatives; and drive pipeline and revenue. And if you’re a freelance content writer or agency owner, you'll learn how to sell this high-ticket offer to clients. (The course includes my cold email template.) Can I create research reports on my own?To execute a research report according to my playbook, you need several skillsets working together: project management, data analysis, writing, graphic design, web development, analytics, and paid ads. If you're a unicorn, you can do it on your own. If you're a human (like me), you can handle several pieces of the pie (e.g., project management, survey building, report writing), and delegate or outsource the rest. How long will it take to see results?If you need to deliver immediate leads to your sales team, you can start doing that the day you launch the report. If you follow my distribution and promotion advice, your reports can generate leads and revenue for one year or more! How much does it cost?$195, which may seem pricey at first glance. But when you know how to create content that drives qualified pipeline and revenue, it’s easier to negotiate a six-figure salary. And when you have proof that you deliver results—and use a proven playbook—clients are more likely to sign that $10,000+ contract. (I offer three report packages ranging in price from $12,650-$35,150 ... and they sell like hot cakes.)How long does the course take to complete?The video lessons take roughly 60 minutes to watch. Then, you should spend another 30 or so minutes on your own reviewing the course materials and sample reports.I’m in. Where do I sign up?Cool! Click the blue “I want this!” button. You'll get my course via email ... along with a smidgen of my undying love.About MeHi! I'm Erin. I've had the privilege of leading content teams for seven years—first as a Section Editor and Managing Editor at a Boston-based content marketing agency. And then as Head of Content and Marketing Director at The Predictive Index, a high-growth B2B SaaS company. There, I grew the content team from 1 to 8, helped launch a market category to land a $50M Series A, and generated millions in revenue from content ($1M+ from research reports alone). Holla!Over the past decade, I've worked with 100+ B2B companies as a strategist, editor, and writer. A few you might know include HubSpot, Drift, G2, Intuit, Greenhouse, Zenefits, Showpad, Intellum, and Metadata. My content marketing and team leadership insights have been featured by the American Marketing Association, Content Marketing Institute, Content Marketing Conference, ASJA, Masters of Content, Content Logistics, Orbit Media, and more. In my free time, I like to get tattoos, drink wine, and take long sits on the couch.",
