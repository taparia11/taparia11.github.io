I always try to get great quotes from clients talking about how our work impacted them, like a marketing exec telling us things like — ‘We’re getting anecdotal reports from sales that there’s a lot more awareness about who we are. It’s making it much easier for us to call into them.’\n\nDepending on how you’re distributing the content, you might want to have some benchmarks in mind. Like if you’re doing paid distribution, you can work off of average click rates that you find from things like HubSpot reports — or over time you can develop your own benchmarks for whatever verticals you’re operating in.\n\nI love distributing on LinkedIn because I can target specific companies and then show the demographics of what companies are actually clicking on ads, etc. — and then tracking whether or not they click around your website and all that good stuff.",
