Understanding the core ideas these CEOs build bigger ideas around and echoing them in all content pieces.\nFor example, a CEO that is a sustainability advocate will talk a little about sustainability even when writing about financing. ‘Not monitoring personal expenditure is a deeply unsustaible way to gauge your finances. It leads to wastage of monetary resources that could otherwise have been deployed elsewhere.’ \n\nThe idea is to understand what this person cares about on a personal front as and then frame content from that _perspective_ not just the language. \nThis takes time and exposure to multiple long form formats but is achievable over time.\n\n2. Printing out edits from my editor\/strategist &gt; grouping changes under sub heads such as ‘tone’, ‘clarity’ and ‘context’ and then narrowing down on the tone parameters. \nInitially this seems like a lot of work but in my experience it’s the only way to get better much quicker. \n\n3. It was great when I got speaking and writing samples but what was better was when I was given the context as well. \nFor example if a CEO is addressing fundraising in a speaking sample is the target to help an audience of founders raise funds or to educate a university class on fundraising? \n\nThis context will monumentally change the way the CEO talks. \n\nI know I’m a little late to the thread but I hope this helps!

The first one was purely focused on defining the execs' \"thought leadership persona,\" so we asked them to bring examples of writers \/ experts they like. We unpacked those, along with doing some free association of modifiers they would use to describe themselves and those they want to steer clear of.\n\nWe wrapped up with a quick, fun exercise where execs had to take a stance on a Very Important Question (e.g., \"is a hotdog a sandwich?\" \"are cupcakes superior to cake?\") It was kind of silly, but allowed us to see how each person formulates opinions and arguments.",

The first one was purely focused on defining the execs' \"thought leadership persona,\" so we asked them to bring examples of writers \/ experts they like. We unpacked those, along with doing some free association of modifiers they would use to describe themselves and those they want to steer clear of.\n\nWe wrapped up with a quick, fun exercise where execs had to take a stance on a Very Important Question (e.g., \"is a hotdog a sandwich?\" \"are cupcakes superior to cake?\") It was kind of silly, but allowed us to see how each person formulates opinions and arguments."
