Volume is a big factor, as well as how the channels are run by the client.\n\nFor a smaller client with less budget, comboing the content dev into one person works well. Having the article writer do the social and help with any other form of content is good because the OG author hopefully understands their own hooks and whatnot.\n\nBut that person can get overwhelmed if the volume is too intense. Corners might start to get cut, less love could go into social posts, etc. Having a fresh set of eyes to write social can also be good, as the new person might see a new angle or interpretation, might be able to inject more excitement and intrigue since they're not so 'close' to the writing.\n\nThis gets expensive though... so you need a client with budget and volume to match.",

Volume is a big factor, as well as how the channels are run by the client.\n\nFor a smaller client with less budget, comboing the content dev into one person works well. Having the article writer do the social and help with any other form of content is good because the OG author hopefully understands their own hooks and whatnot.\n\nBut that person can get overwhelmed if the volume is too intense. Corners might start to get cut, less love could go into social posts, etc. Having a fresh set of eyes to write social can also be good, as the new person might see a new angle or interpretation, might be able to inject more excitement and intrigue since they're not so 'close' to the writing.\n\nThis gets expensive though... so you need a client with budget and volume to match."
