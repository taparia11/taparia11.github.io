Would love to hear how you all address this in your orgs.\n\nMy team is talking content reporting\/metrics and I'd love to get some input -- measurement and reporting are definitely not my strong suit. As far as I can tell, measurements fall into two different buckets:\n1. *How \"hook-y\" is the content?* - Is it bringing in new leads\/bringing new people to our website?\n2. *Is the content high-quality?* - Is it of interest to our audience, and is it helping move them down the sales funnel?\n\nThe first lends itself to more classic content metrics (downloads, MoM organic blog traffic growth, etc), but the second is trickier. We can measure things like webinar audience attendance rate to see if people are engaging with the content, but that doesn't help make the leap to whether we're engaging with our target audience. I'm thinking we need to be measuring something like Pipeline Influenced or Opportunities Influenced, but the feedback is that those metrics belong to other depts. (Opportunities Influenced, for example, would be owned by Sales Enablement, which coaches the sales team on how to use the content created by my team.)\n\nWe're currently kicking around *Inquiry -&gt; AQL conversion rate* (which theoretically is measuring the success of our lead warming email campaigns, which use content to increase people's lead score to the point we believe they're ready to be contacted by sales). I don't think this fully captures the impact of our content.\n\nAny thoughts on the best way to measure the *business impact* of content? I realize this is a perennial struggle for content marketers, so I'd also love to have a conversation with anyone who has strong opinions on this!",
