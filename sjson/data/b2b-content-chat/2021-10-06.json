Aside from being B2B only, it’s different from HARO because sources get to be more granular when selecting their expertise.\n\nHARO has one single wire for “business and finance” sources. If a source is looking to contribute to requests about SEO, for example, they’d have to sieve through HARO’s 30+ daily business and finance requests to find them.\n\nHaB2BW is different. Sources can subscribe to 20+ individual wires. So, the SEO expert could subscribe to the SEO wire and *only get emailed those requests*.\n\nIt’s a win-win for writers and sources. Writers reach the exact type of B2B professional they want to quote, and sources don’t have to scan through hundreds of irrelevant requests to find the queries they can respond to :smile:",

                "text": "In this course, I walk you through the EXACT playbook I use to create market research reports people actually want to read ... like the 2020 Remote Work Report, which has driven $557k in revenue (so far).I also answer all your burning questions: How do I get valid data? What if the data doesn't support the story I want to tell? Am I supposed to gate the report for lead gen? How do I project manage all the moving parts? Why is my butt itchy? (Well on second thought, not ALL of your burning questions.) If you know me from my LinkedIn posts, you know my content has an edge to it. So expect some sarcasm, and maybe a swear or two. And expect to walk away with the knowledge and confidence you need to start creating your own research reports. Course PreviewLesson 1: Course IntroWelcome + objectivesLesson 2: Planning + Project Management Organizing all the moving pieces + setting clear expectationsLesson 3: Data Collection + AnalysisSecuring an audience, writing questions + analyzing raw dataLesson 4: Report Writing + DesignTurning an outline into a polished reportLesson 5: WebDev + TrackingSetting up campaign tracking + QALesson 6: Organic Promotion + PRGenerating attention + leadsLesson 7: Paid Promotion Planning ads + writing ad copyLesson 8: Sales Enablement Helping sales have more productive conversations Lesson 9: Post-launchAnalyzing results + making process improvementsLesson 10: Monetization How to sell research reports to clientsLesson 11: My Writing Process (Bonus)How I do data storytelling, step-by-stepFAQsWho’s this course for?1. In-house B2B marketers and writers who want to produce bigger business results, hit their numbers, impress their bosses, and get promoted. 2. Freelance content writers and marketing agency owners who want to earn more money by adding a high-ticket item to their services menu. Who's this course NOT for?This is an advanced content marketing course. If you don't understand basic content marketing principles and tactics, this course will go over your head. You should also have strong writing skills—or an experienced writer you can assign work to. Why should I listen to you?I’ve been leading content teams for seven years. First as a Managing Editor at Brafton, a Boston-based content marketing agency. And then as a Marketing Director at The Predictive Index, a B2B SaaS company that's made the Inc. 5000 \"fastest-growing companies\" list four years in a row. There, I grew the content team from 1 to 8, helped launch a market category, and drove over $1M in revenue from research reports alone.I've worked with 100+ B2B SaaS companies as a writer, strategist, and consultant. Some you might know are HubSpot, Drift, G2, Intuit, Greenhouse, Zenefits, Showpad, Intellum, and Metadata. I've been featured as a content marketing subject matter expert by the American Marketing Association, Content Marketing Institute, Content Marketing Conference, ASJA, Masters of Content, Orbit Media, and more. What will I learn in this course?You’ll learn a step-by-step process for creating and distributing B2B marketing research reports. You'll also learn how to get better results over time. And if you’re a freelance content writer or agency owner, you'll learn how to sell this high-ticket offer to clients. (The course includes a cold email template.)Can I create research reports on my own?To execute a research report according to my playbook, you need several skillsets working together: project management, data analysis, writing, graphic design, web development, analytics, and paid ads. If you're a unicorn, you can do it on your own. If you're a human (like me), you can handle several pieces of the pie (e.g., project management, survey building, report writing), and delegate or outsource the rest. How long will it take to see results?If you need to deliver immediate leads to your sales team, you can start doing that the day you launch the report. If you follow my distribution and promotion advice, your reports can generate leads and revenue for one year or more! How much does it cost?$150, which may seem pricey at first glance. But when you know how to create content that drives qualified pipeline and revenue, it’s easier to negotiate a six-figure salary. And when you have proof that you deliver results—and use a proven playbook—clients are more likely to sign that $10,000+ contract. How long does the course take to complete?The video lessons take roughly 60 minutes to watch. Then, you should spend another 30 or so minutes reviewing the course materials and sample reports.I’m in. Where do I sign up?Cool! Click the blue “I want this!” button. You'll get my course via email ... along with a smidgen of my undying love.",
