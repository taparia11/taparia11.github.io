Something that can be helpful for brainstorming social content is having a list of go-to content categories—this might either be part of your core social content strategy, or is something you can develop based on the project or campaign you’re creating content for. Example--if I’m a sustainable coffee brand with a big community focus my core categories might include:\n• How to brew (education)\n• People of [brand] (employee and grower spotlights)\n• Creativity in coffee (latte art etc)\n• Community (UGC, discussion, engagement)\n• Experience [brand] (shop features, highlights, promoting product)\n• etc\nFor me, having some parameters actually sparks more creativity. I also work for a social media software company and we have a ton of content on this topic including a <https:\/\/sproutsocial.com\/insights\/templates\/social-content-inspiration-worksheet\/|content inspiration worksheet>.
