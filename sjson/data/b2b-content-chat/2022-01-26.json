Host the podcast on a webpage that offers a relevant downloadable offering i.e. a checklist related to the podcast or a cheat sheet of key podcast takeaways. you can then track conversions and emails captured as leads that you can nurture. here's a formula that I'd recommend: A) Host a new podcast episode on a blog page. B) Get a transcript of the podcast and use that as the main body of the blog. this allows you to offer content (seo-friendly too!) without having to write any net new content. include links to other web pages, which can be another KPI - how much traffic does the podcast page drive to a product page, for example C) identify the 10 top takeaways from the podcast (or 5 or 20!) and put them into a pdf with nice design and gate it. now you can track leads against it. Voila!",

B) Get a transcript of the podcast and use that as the main body of the blog. this allows you to offer content (seo-friendly too!) without having to write any net new content. include links to other web pages, which can be another KPI - how much traffic does the podcast page drive to a product page, for example C) identify the 10 top takeaways from the podcast (or 5 or 20!) and put them into a pdf with nice design and gate it. now you can track leads against it.
