Our solution is a tiered system in which we expect every piece of content on Adeft to go through a series of editors: an initial review by a freelance editor who knows something about the marketing space (but wouldn't qualify as an expert practitioner), an SME review for content accuracy, and a final review by a technical writer\/old-school copyeditor-type person. (This isn't quite as expensive as it sounds, especially if the original author of the content is an SME.)\n• We've always had more success hiring editors who have some experience as practitioners vs. editors who don't know the space.
