I’ve found the best way to avoid being a service provider \/ internal agency for every other team is to set very clear team goal, KPIs, and roadmap for your the team and every content marketer in your team. For example, if your team goal is SEO\/traffic then anything that’s not contributing to that (e.g. emails\/ads) would be a low priority (only if you have time), etc. Or if your team goal is organic growth then you shouldn’t be focusing on creating ad copy.
