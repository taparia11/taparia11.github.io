Why?\n\nI’ve heard of different variations of this, e.g. content within growth or content within the brand team, so I’m curious to know if there’s an “ideal” team make-up. As a content marketer myself I think content should be a separate team reporting to the most senior marketing leader but I understand it might differ by company size, the goals of the content team, etc. Still, would still love to hear everyone’s thoughts and experience!",
