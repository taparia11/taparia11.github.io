They would also seek input on product accuracy from the Product Manager or the person that's driving overall development.\n\nBased on that input, the writer would develop the material and then the Marketing and Product stakeholders would review. Product - specifically for Product accuracy, Marketing - specifically for alignment with positioning.\n\nThat's the easiest way to describe the interaction. It's what I did as an external consultant, and it's what I do while in-house. The main difference between the two is that with full-time you're doing a higher volume of shorter assets (content blocks, talking points, UX copy) whereas for an external consultant, it's best to have them handle bigger assets like blogs, gated content, etc.\n\nFeel free to DM if you have additional questions :slightly_smiling_face:",
