We all had 5-10 minutes (?) to write down everything we should stop doing (overcommitting, selling gigs we coudln't staff, designing decks without first obtaining content approval). Then \"Start\" (start insisting that the client respond with content edits in 48 hours, start doing a team lunch on Fridays). And, finally, \"Continue.\" Continue with daily standups, weekly demos, etc.\n\nOf course, we didn't make this up. You can find lots of how-tos for this approach.",
