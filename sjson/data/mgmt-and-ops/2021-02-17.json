I'm asking a member of our Sales team to be my new hire's \"buddy\" so she can learn about how sales works at our company. I'm recommending that my new hire meets with the Onboarding Buddy for the first 3-4 weeks for virtual syncs\/get-to-know-you chats. Also, asking that the Buddy invites her to sit in on 5-10 sales calls.\n• I want my new hire to get up-to-speed and learn by doing. For example, in the 90-day onboarding plan, I've specified four blog assignments that she'll take on during the first 6-8 weeks (super detailed prompts; hand-feeding resources and info to make her successful). The goal is for her to be iterating on and shipping content as soon as possible. After the onboarding period, we'll integrate her into our content calendar planning, at which point she'll be pitching and pursuing her own ideas (vs. me giving her assignments).  ",
