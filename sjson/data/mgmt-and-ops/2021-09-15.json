I'm kicking off the hiring process for a content marketer in my team, and I would like to find an effective way to test applicants' writing skills. :writing_hand:\n\nI've found portfolios to be misleading at times, as they often feature content re-written and edited by a full team of editors. Do you have any tips on:\n\n• What type of task works best to test writing skills (we're talking B2B SaaS blog content)\n• How much should I pay applicants for the time and effort spent completing the task?\nFor context: I previously asked candidates to flesh out their content creation process (how do they find ideas for content? How do they prioritise them? What do they consider when writing the piece?). But for this new role, it is very important for me to find a very good writer above all else, so that's why I'm considering changing approach.\n\nThank you in advance :raised_hands:",
