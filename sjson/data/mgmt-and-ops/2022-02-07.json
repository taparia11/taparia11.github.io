We use a concept called training months, which often happen in the initial few months but can also be assigned down the road if, for example, a writer has to learn a new type of content that slows down their productivity. We have shifting content priorities, so not everyone learns the same type of content at the same point.\n\nThat said, there certainly is more structure early on. A typical first week looks something like this:\n• Orientation call with me on the first day to talk about things like company values, KPIs and logistics\n• Intro call with the writing team the person will be joining, where we do intros and ice breaker questions\n• Begin working through the training resources, which cover processes, content types, the tools we use, etc.\n• I do a live walkthrough of our main tools and how we use them to take projects through the content production workflow\n• Weekly team meeting where they meet everyone on the content team\n• End-of-week 1:1 with me to debrief and set the stage for the following week\n• If they're ready, they begin working on their first piece of content\n• Admin tasks (paperwork, work laptop, etc.)\n• Meeting with our VP of Marketing to discuss our broader content\/marketing strategy and talk about where the company was, where we are today and where we're headed\n• Thursday stand up with me and their team (we do the team intro call in lieu of our Monday stand up) \nFrom there, things become less structured, but generally week 2 is focused on working through the edits of their first piece with their editor. Then learning the publishing process. And if they have time, starting their next piece of content. A couple weeks in (there's not a hard timeline_, I also ask them to fill out a survey covering topics like what they're good at, what they need from me, how they like to receive recognition, something important to them outside work. Just to get to know them better, open the door for conversations, understand what they did\/didn't appreciate about previous managers, etc. That way I have a clear idea of how to be the best manager possible for them.\n\nIt's not directly part of onboarding, but I have check-ins at the 30, 60 and 90-day mark to talk about wins, challenges and performance from the previous month, answer questions, and address any issues that may have cropped up.\n\nSomething else I've prioritized is the pre-onboarding to connect before day 1. I send out a preparation email the week before so that new hires know what to expect on their first day. This also establishes a line of communication in case they have any questions leading up to their start date.\n\nIn that email, I send a survey asking for a bio, some fun facts and their favorite hobby to share with the team. The survey also has a few basic questions to establish how they best learn and how hands-on they want me and their editor to be at the start. The goal being to understand how we can best support them from the get-go.\n\nHope that helps!",

Then learning the publishing process. And if they have time, starting their next piece of content. A couple weeks in (there's not a hard timeline_, I also ask them to fill out a survey covering topics like what they're good at, what they need from me, how they like to receive recognition, something important to them outside work. Just to get to know them better, open the door for conversations, understand what they did\/didn't appreciate about previous managers, etc. That way I have a clear idea of how to be the best manager possible for them.\n\nIt's not directly part of onboarding, but I have check-ins at the 30, 60 and 90-day mark to talk about wins, challenges and performance from the previous month, answer questions, and address any issues that may have cropped up.\n\nSomething else I've prioritized is the pre-onboarding to connect before day 1. I send out a preparation email the week before so that new hires know what to expect on their first day. This also establishes a line of communication in case they have any questions leading up to their start date.\n\nIn that email, I send a survey asking for a bio, some fun facts and their favorite hobby to share with the team. The survey also has a few basic questions to establish how they best learn and how hands-on they want me and their editor to be at the start. The goal being to understand how we can best support them from the get-go.\n\nHope that helps!"
