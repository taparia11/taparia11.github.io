Oh, and you can turn on a reminder to start tracking time every ten minutes if there’s no timer set.\n\nTime tracking is a huge PITA but that makes it easier if you’re only doing it for a couple of weeks. I did find using the dashboards and reporting quite unintuitive, but perhaps I didn’t spend enough time setting up my projects etc.",
