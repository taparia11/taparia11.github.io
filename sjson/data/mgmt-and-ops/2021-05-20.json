We’ll always tackle theirs first unless there’s something urgent\n• They’re sacred and we should avoid canceling or rescheduling at all costs\n• Calling out that this isn’t a time for status updates. We have daily scrum notes in slack so we can get one another’s status update items in there. Strategy and coaching is cool for work-related conversations, but just listing off “I did this, and this, and this” isn’t a good use of either of your time\nI do think having an agenda has helped me significantly though - as a direct report to avoid those status update conversations - and as a manager to keep track of all of our conversations so nothing slips my mind.\n\nWe wrote a big guide here about a lot of the principles we use at Soapbox as they relate to 1:1s: <https:\/\/soapboxhq.com\/one-on-one-meeting-guide>",
