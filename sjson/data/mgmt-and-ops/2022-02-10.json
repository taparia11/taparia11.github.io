        "text": "PLEASE NOTE: I’M NO LONGER TAKING ENTRIES, BECAUSE I’VE WRAPPED UP THE COMPENSATION SURVEY.\n\n\n\n\n\nHi, everyone. I’m executive editor of <http:\/\/Future.com|Future.com>, part of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Previously, I was VP of content at NerdWallet, which IPO’d last year.\n\nA request for any folks who work in content or marketing:\n\nI’m currently crowd-sourcing compensation info directly from individuals. If you share your info with me, I will share back all the entries I collect from individuals. That’s in the interest of knowing where you stand in the market and whether you can do better.\n\nThis is what entries will look like for example, once I anonymize them:\n\n• Editor in chief at a business trade publication \/ website based in NYC. Manages 10. Hybrid remote. $180k base. 25% bonus. $35k RSUs (vesting over three years).\n• VP of marketing at a series B startup based in the Bay Area. 100% remote. $250k base. 30% bonus. .75 equity in the company, vested over four years.\nNote: I don’t collect the original info anonymously, because I use such info to make recommendations to startups and other companies on how to pay so they’re competitive in the market for talent. I need to be able to trust the info I collect to make such recommendations, and that’s not possible with info collected anonymously.\n\nFWIW, when I was at NerdWallet, leading a content team of ~100, we would crowd-source like this — our content folks would share what offers they were seeing from other employers. That’s so I could make sure that we stayed competitive in compensation. Because our team was large and many of us were recruited for jobs, we could cross-check offers pretty easily.\n\nIn case useful, this is my LinkedIn profile: <http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/maggieleung1|http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/maggieleung1>\n\nIf you share your info with me and I share aggregated info with you, I will expect you to not publish it anywhere or otherwise distribute it. That’s because that would mean that there’d be much less incentive for more people to share such info with me, which would mean I couldn’t continue to help raise other boats.\n\nMy philosophy: I do not try to underpay or lowball people, because I want there to be strong compensation in my field. I want more and more good jobs to exist, so we can all have more choices.\n\nCurrently, I’m one of the best paid content people in the world. I couldn’t easily change jobs without taking a big cut at most companies. That’s not a big deal, because I can afford to retire if I want. I mention that in case it helps to know: I’m not your competition and I have no ulterior motive.\n\nMy agenda: I want content to be a force in business. I do not want content or marketing folks to be some kind of underclass. When salaries are opaque, that can happen much more easily.\n\nIf you want to share your info, please DM me.\n\nThe info needed:\n\n• Your role or title\n• Your base salary\n• Any bonus\n• Any equity\n• Any signing bonus\n• Where your employer is located\n• Whether you can work 100% remotely permanently (because individuals can control cost of living if they can choose where to live)\nAgain, once I collect this info and know it’s reliable, I will then remove your name and anonymize your company name before sharing out the aggregated info among other content and marketing people who are participating. I will not share the info with nonparticipants.",
