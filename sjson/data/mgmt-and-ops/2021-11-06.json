That's just for managing the content production workflow. We also use Slack and G chat for comms, and Drive for storing our docs, spreadsheets, training materials, etc. It's not the most efficient tbh.\n\nWe're about to switch to ClickUp and from what I've seen, it's going to be way better. Much more holistic and centralized, and able to incorporate task management beyond just the content process, which is something I've wanted. It's going to be a lot more flexible and give me way better visibility into key areas, too.",
