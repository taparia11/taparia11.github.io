I have 1 direct report, someone who’s been with the company 3 years more than me. She’s experienced in other disciplines of SEO but is learning the nuances of content\/editorial. She often takes longer to, say, write and research a content brief than it would take me.\n\nI’ve been super accommodating \/ patient with her, but she routinely exceeds time scoped for most tasks, and _my_ boss is noticing. So, I want to update her OKRs so that they’re clear, attainable, and get work done.\n\nI tend to be someone who only needs an assignment and a deadline to get something done, rather than estimating chunks of hours associated with a bigger task. It’s my struggle as a manager to enforce hour targets. That won’t work, as we’re a small company that’s growing quickly and I need to make sure we’re not swamped. I feel like the swamped one trying to help my assistant content person succeed. TIA for any feedback.",
