I think I had internalized the stereotype that writing\/content doesn't make you much money so that was great to see. &lt;&lt;\n \n\n&gt;&gt; My first reaction: I need to ask for a raise or start looking for a new job =D &lt;&lt;\n\n\n&gt;&gt; I think the most amazing thing was the spread of salary ranges across seemingly similar roles and numbers of direct reports. … My biggest takeaway though is that there is still soooo much money to be made in content so I shouldn't sell myself short. &lt;&lt;\n\n\n&gt;&gt; It was really insightful. And it really highlights that different organizations value content differently. I definitely need to study it closer as I plan my future. &lt;&lt;\n\n\n&gt;&gt; Honestly it was really encouraging to see how well we can do in content if we rise to senior roles in good orgs. I still have a lot to learn to get there, but your list was motivating. &lt;&lt;\n\n\nA number of participants were surprised by the variations in compensation, which ran from $47k to a few seven-figure packages.\n\nThere was a concentration of roles from $100k to $250k, including many with bonuses and equity (shared ownership of a company). Nearly all of the jobs can be done 100% remotely.\n\nNote: I won’t be sharing the salary survey results publicly, because the info was collected on the understanding of confidentiality so participants would be transparent about their names, company names, etc. I did that because I get better fidelity as someone who helps companies set compensation — they need to know what relevant companies pay (not what random companies pay; they don't care about competing against crappy companies). I also don’t believe that cheaping out helps good employers hire and retain well, so I focus on the higher end of earnings.\n\n\n\n",
