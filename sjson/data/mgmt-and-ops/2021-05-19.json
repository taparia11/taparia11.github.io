Super helpful!\n\nGreat questions <@URAV154AV>, thanks for sharing.\n\n<@U0113AV4895> I like the idea of having a sort of kickoff to learn more about the person’s work style, etc., and then just making an open floor for future meetings.\n\n<@U01AHL8AGBB> I often feel like my team has already talked to me about more small-talky kind of things, so then it feels like there’s not as much need for life updates. But it’s a good reminder to be interested\/checking in\/remembering what my team tells me is going on with them.\n\nMy team also craves more time to be heads down and fewer extra meetings (we are a lot of introverts!) so I don’t want them to feel forced into casually talking.\n\nBut anyway, thanks! These are great ideas. :slightly_smiling_face:",
