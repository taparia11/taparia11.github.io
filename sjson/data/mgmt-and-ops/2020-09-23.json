Meetings include marketing, CEO and our Global Creative Director (we are a design company, so he’s a great resource). We do quarterly meetings too, but monthly is to review the calendar and make changes as we see fit. \n\nWe have 4 different content buckets, and aim to have a certain distribution of each type of post per month. (SEO, sales enablement, etc).\n\nI gather content ideas (which is ongoing) and put them into buckets in Asana. That way when we have our meetings we can review the ideas together and make the final decisions on what will be produced that month\/quarter. I usually outline what I think makes sense first, but just as an idea\/starting point.\n\nThen it’s on me to brief, assign to writers etc!\n\nDefinitely more of a collaborative process, but I like it. If we had a full content team I’m sure it would be different, but with a small startup this type of structure seems to work. Better than getting a message half way through the month saying “why are we writing this and not this?” :joy: ",
