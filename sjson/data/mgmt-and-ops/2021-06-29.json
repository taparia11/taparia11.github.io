And I'm struggling.\n\nFor context, my content team is part of the Marketing team for a B2B SaaS (with 3 products) that relies heavily on inbound marketing.\n\nAs the team lead, my title is Content Manager and I report to the Director of Marketing.\n\nLast year we hired a content writer and since then she has taken responsibility for:\n\nManaging our blogs. She creates briefs and manages our freelance writers, edits and uploads all our blog posts. Chooses the topics we will write about and optimizes older posts. She also comes up with other content resources that support our blog posts, for example, templates, guidelines, etc.\n\nI want to change her job title to Blog Manager. As I feel that describes her role best. But, my manager doesn't like that title, because she feels that the word \"blog\" is restrictive. \n\nDoes anyone have any idea of titles that would be suitable for her responsiblities?",
