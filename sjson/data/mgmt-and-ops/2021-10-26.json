To start, we compile feedback once every week for the first 4 weeks, then once per month from then on out. It's not as efficient as every-article feedback, but if a writer _knows_ they're getting an email once a month with feedback on articles and areas to improve, it ends up feeling much less overwhelming. We liked that balance after trying to do feedback after each article.\n\nI also LOVE the Loom thing, which we've done on occasion for things that needed more visual explanations.",
