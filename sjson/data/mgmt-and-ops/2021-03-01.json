I’m at a Series A and have most of my marketing spend\/team directed at TOFU\/awareness, and marketing ops (measurement\/tracking). I won’t be in a position to hire FT for the near term.\n\nSpecifically, I envision we will need content support as we move further towards a self-serve product, andI  have a couple channel partnerships that need support. We don’t have a product leader at the moment. While I have a marketing manager freelancer and a writer — neither seems like a fit for working on this type of content. And if I am being honest, it is not really where my interest lies either.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with this sort of situation or suggestions on what you've done when your internal resources are limited?",
