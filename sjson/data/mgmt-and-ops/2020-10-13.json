In the beginning, I was making assignment decisions off of keyword research, sales calls, and blog performance. Now it's turned into my team taking requests from other marketing team members to create their ad copy, email copy, landing page copy, direct mail copy, blog announcements, etc. It feels.... like not the best use of my team's time. However, if that's what's best for the business - we'll stay on course. My question is - how often are you creating content for other marketing team members? Or - alternatively - are you able to determine your teams priorities and just review the work of other team members instead? I'd love to hear how other content teams function so I can better inform our leadership and set our team in the right direction.",
