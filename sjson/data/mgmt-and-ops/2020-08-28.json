I have tried to source material for _multiple_ posts via a single interview but haven't had tons of success with that (especially if I'm gathering info via email or a survey).\n\nThe best and cheapest hack I know of is to pull expert quotes from other places---webinars, blog posts, social media, etc.\n\n(The most wasteful thing I see is people bothering experts to give them \"their top tip\" on XYZ, which they already could've found a million places online. Experts are there to tell you things you don't already know or to call out best practices as insufficient, unrealistic, or flat-out wrong.)\n\nBut I do love a good in-person interview.

We have 9 levels overall - L1-L3, you're getting a lot of direction from your Strategist (manager) on calendar management, pitches, reporting, approaches to individual articles. L4-L6, you take point but get input from your strategist when you need it - L7 and up, you run the show and maybe get some backup from a Strategist when things get really complicated.\n\nWe also have a dedicated team for research, so CMs across the board can get help on that front (as long as they fill out a brief and get it on the research calendar in a timely manner :wink:)",

What changes as Content Managers level up is the amount of autonomy they're expected to operate with. We have 9 levels overall - L1-L3, you're getting a lot of direction from your Strategist (manager) on calendar management, pitches, reporting, approaches to individual articles. L4-L6, you take point but get input from your strategist when you need it - L7 and up, you run the show and maybe get some backup from a Strategist when things get really complicated.\n\nWe also have a dedicated team for research, so CMs across the board can get help on that front (as long as they fill out a brief and get it on the research calendar in a timely manner "
