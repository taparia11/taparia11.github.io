We are located in 80 countries so we have a lot of hurdles to figure out what content works where and whether written, audio, or video is the best play for us.  Do any of you have tips on helping an organization pivot into new means of marketing and prospecting knowing that we may not see many quick results while we work out the initial bumps in the road?  Any tips would be helpful!",

You’re going to need all the support you can get.\n• Start small – no one in my client’s industry did any real content marketing so small things like having a good website, a regular content schedule etc. actually made a lot of noise. So don’t think you need to do a lot, all at once. Get the basics covered and slowly build up (especially if you’re a super large organization).\n• Sync with the sales team. Animalz has a really good article on this actually. \n• Enhance whatever existing marketing there is – I think the impulse when you’re doing new marketing initiatives is to just brainstorm 100% new things.
