We've been looking into virtual office space options for having efficient, collaborative communication while we're all online, but I haven't used something like this before and don't want to spend the money on it if it's not worth the hassle.\n\nFor context, our team is current 4 in-house folks and is likely to grow by at least a couple of people in 2022. \n\nMy two questions are:\n\n1. What has been your experience using a virtual coworking platform? Effective? Waste of time\/resources? Might as well just use Slack?\n2. If you had a good experience, which platform do you recommend?\nTIA!",
