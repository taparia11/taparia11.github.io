I'm new to a role where I'm handling copywriting\/content for a small ecommerce company with about 20 products. I'm responsible for the product pages as well as supplementary, education-type blogs, so I'm trying to learn as much as I can about the products AND the industry overall... but it's been really challenging. I either get information that turns out to be incorrect, or it takes forever tracking down the right information or the right person to ask on the team. Not sure if it's an issue with the process (or lack thereof) OR it's a communication issue with the team members that I've been going to! Any tips?",
