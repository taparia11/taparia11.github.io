We would be looking at 1,000+ content briefs this year alone.  We're currently using SEO Surfer for content optimization and we have our own internal process on building content briefs using SEMRush and SEO Surfer.  It's fairly thorough and covers possible cannibalization, search intent, competition analysis, KW research, amongst other things.  Usually it takes me 30 minutes to complete each one but the real problematic ones can sometimes take an upwards of an hour.  I dont have a benchmark for what the standard time to build a content brief should be, so that adds more uncertainty to the issue.\n\nI'm not sure if the bottleneck should be solved by hiring several contractors to build out more briefs or by simplifying what might be an overcomplicated content brief process.  Any insight?  We have never been a mass content producer but we are starting to head in that direction and any insight would be great.",
