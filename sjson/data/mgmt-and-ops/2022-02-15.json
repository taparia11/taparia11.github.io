(biggest focus) customer facing messaging and language, including core responsibility for messaging on website, top tier content, etc.  It’s a copywriting focused role (as in I definitely need someone who can execute real copy for a variety of channels), but with the need for an extended skillset around higher-level positioning, as well as understanding of design\/web to collaborate with designer to create web pages that accomplish objectives and get the message across.\n\nIt seems a bit like an Associate Creative Director role.
