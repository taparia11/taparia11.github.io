I’m preparing to offer a 3-6 month writing contract to someone, but am trying to come up a fair rate that reflects anticipated workload from multiple clients. I don’t want them to be idle, nor do I want to overload them. Hard to account for such variability in a contract.",

The workload expectations are clear. X pieces per month, delivered biweekly, or something like that.\n\nHowevah, your timing is curious here. I’m preparing to offer a 3-6 month writing contract to someone, but am trying to come up a fair rate that reflects anticipated workload from multiple clients. I don’t want them to be idle, nor do I want to overload them. Hard to account for such variability in a contract."
