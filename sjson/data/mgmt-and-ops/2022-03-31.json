I just started as SDR for my mid-sized company few months ago. Here is my cold email toolbox.\n\nBouncer - I use Bouncer to verify all the emails before sending. The accuracy rate is around a 98%.\n\nCliently- I use Cliently to send all the emails for myself and some of my client accounts. The best part is that I am able to manage all my email accounts at one place. So instead of opening\/managing various tabs\/browsers, I just do everything at one place including replying to emails (so not forwarding emails to one address) and I currently do outreach from 4 emails.\n\nGsuite - I use Gsuite for all the cold email campaigns I run. Also I buy one domain from one workspace and have 2-3 emails associated with each. Keep some in reserves, since some 20-30% burn.\n\nLinkedin Sales Navigator, Zoominfo and Salesql - I use Linkedin to find target audience. For high ticket prospects, I use Zoominfo since it is more targeted but expensive.  Sales Navigator is decent for me. Salesql is very affordable and has 60% accuracy on emails. I got 30% off on black friday deal.\n\nGmass or Warmupinbox - I use these tools for email warmup. Go with default settings. Gmass is free and Warmupinbox is 10 dollars a month. Anything better here?\n\nHyperise, Nureply, Lyne - For personalization in Videos and Images. Plus few personalized AI written lines (comenting about their linkedin or website)\n\nIs there anything else, I should be doing? Or any way I can make my outreach better?",
