Typically companies start using the :tm: to indicate that they have officially begun the process to legally register their trademarks. A registered trademark is legally defensible.\n\nI'm currently working at an open source company so I've gone far, far deeper on trademark rules than I have at prior companies :sweat_smile: That's been fun.\n\nIn general, I would recommend registering your company name (word mark) and associated logo (logo mark) in the primary regions where you do business. It's a fairly low lift that your lawyer can help you with and will set you up to protect your most important brand assets.\n\nOne of the fun things I learned about trademark law is that if you don't have a history of defending your marks, it makes it much much harder to put a case together if you ever _need_ to defend them. So registering your marks today means that if you're ever in a position in the future where you need to take someone to court for infringing on your marks, you'll actually have some legs to stand on.",
