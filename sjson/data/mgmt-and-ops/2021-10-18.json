They will be taking over 2-3 writers and taking over responsibility for the content calendar, overseeing content quality, working with freelancers, polishing content processes, building out more content capacity, etc.\n\nMy question is... How the frick do I not fall flat on my face hiring for this role? \n\nI've hired writers before, but I've never hired a lead and never someone who would be \"inheriting\" existing team members. How can I check whether they can run 1 on 1s well and set goals for team members and provide excellent feedback for content and drive the content strategy and etc etc etc... All within one recruitment process?!\n\nAny advice at all from you fine people would be greatly appreciated :pray:",
