From there, marketing onboarding doesn’t take that cohort approach but is more a series of individual meetings and trainings set up by their manager\/team. Week 2 is really about meeting your immediate team (1:1s with Content Team, sessions with manager on the marketing org and how we work, self-guided onboarding to make sure you have all the tools you need) and Weeks 3-4 focus on meeting the larger team (Content &amp; Comms, partners throughout Marketing), going deep into past content and customer research\/calls to learn more about our audience, and taking part in trainings to learn the ins and outs of our content process. Starting around week 3, they are likely slowly starting to work on their first piece or project, and ramping from there. After about month 3 they would be in the groove of a normal day-to-day and full workload, while continuing to learn and being encouraged to pursue more informal coffee chats in the broader org.\n\nWe actually just went through a project to create some onboarding templates and standardize the list of meetings\/training options, as well as tools to request, for all marketing new hires—so I’d be happy to chat through that process if you’re interested!",
