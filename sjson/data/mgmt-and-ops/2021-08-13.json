I would add to that, send the SME a list of questions you will be asking them ahead of the call (I usually include them in the meeting invite). They won't always come prepared but it will at least alert them to what you want to cover and it will help you structure the call. In terms of knowing who to ask, that is unfortunately a process of trial and error - but if I find someone has been particularly helpful, I ask them if I can set up more calls with them moving forward (assuring them that I won't bombard them, of course). If you come prepared and keep the discussion focused, they will know what to expect from your calls.",
