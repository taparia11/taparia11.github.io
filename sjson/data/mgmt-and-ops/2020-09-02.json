        "text": "Hey Alli! \n\nI was recently on a hiring panel for our new Social Media and Community Manager. We’re very selective with interviewing, so most people we interview have already 1) Presented a strong resume with solid experience 2) Answered a handful of application questions instead of a cover letter 3) Completed a test project (before proceeding with Interview 2 &amp; 3). Therefore interviews are actually not heavily based on understanding someone’s skills, as those have been discerned previously!\n\nWe do 3 interviews for every hire (Direct Manager, Teammate\/Mentor, C-Suite member) and this is what was asked at each:\n\nInterview 1:\n\nWe are trying to solve a lot of big challenges at Doist. Which one do you find most exciting\/compelling?\nCan you please tell me about a time in your personal life or at work when you united a community together? How did you do that and what was the outcome? \nCan you tell me the strategies you would take to revive the Doist Instagram account? \nDo you think Doist or our products are overlooking any social channels? If so, which channel is it and why would you suggest investing in that channel? \nSocial media can often bring out the worst in people… Can you tell me about how you approach negative feedback? How would you relay negative feedback about one of Doist’s apps to the product team? \nWhat is the last good book that you read? \nWhat are some of your favorite apps on your phone? \nQuestions for me?\n\nInterview 2:\nWhat are some of your favorite brands that you feel do social media really well? What do they do that’s so special?\nWhat’s a social campaign that you worked on that you’re really proud of and how did it come together?\nWe get a lot of inbound requests from companies who want to work on social media collaborations! How would you assess if you wanted to move forward with a collaboration?\nWhat are some of the lessons – positive, negative or both – that you’ve learned while working in social media that you’d bring with you to this role?\nWhen was the last time you had to learn a new concept or a new skill? How did you approach it?\nWho is someone you admire or look up to?\nDo you have any questions for me?\n\nInterview 3\n\nWho are you and what should I know about you?\nWhat’s your motivation behind applying?\nHow do you structure your work day?\nWhat do you like about collaborating in teams and what do you dislike about it? \nAre you a person that enjoys to take risk or are you more one who likes to play it safe? \nWhen you’re faced with an emergency situation, how do you react?\nWhat’s the best (or worst) piece of advice you’ve ever gotten? \nTell me a story about how luck played a role in your life. \nTell me about a popular belief that you disagree with?",
