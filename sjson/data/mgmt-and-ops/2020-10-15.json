We've aligned with the design and web development team on this - the only challenge we're facing is that if a project needs to go through content, design, and web development - it can take 6 weeks to complete (three sprints each.) We're trying to be more flexible here but it's challenging to be the team that has to begin and complete all the work well before everyone else.\n\nThe most helpful part of this process is that we have senior leadership and stakeholders join us once every two weeks. During that meeting we lay out our priorities based off business needs. That way, if someone's project isn't chosen, they have to be a bit more understanding.\n\n<@URB31QKM4> - I think it’s amazing your team handles the SEO specifics, editing, and artwork of a piece but encourages the stakeholder to complete their own writing! That sounds extremely collaborative and like a good middle ground.\n\nI also agree on the argument for a new team member! I’m hoping with our sprint process I can show how many hours are being assigned to us in a particular area, and why we need assistance. \n\n<@UUXPJ96EQ> I couldn’t agree more with your first sentence lol! So true. The KPIs are helpful. I think that could be something I could structure out for each individual team member. This person’s goal is traffic and conversion - but this person is focused on usage and guidance, etc.",
