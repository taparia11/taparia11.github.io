        "text": "Thanks <@U019P0ADPCH>. Our Growth Marketing Strategists are typically in charge of strategy\/client communication, unless it’s a content marketing only retainer, then our Content Marketing Strategists will also be in charge of strategy\/comms. This cuts out any unnecessary middle-person, so we can work more closely with the client and be much more strategic with our content.\n\nWe hire content marketing specialists and strategists instead of just writers because we specialize in B2B SaaS growth marketing, so we want our content marketers to be able to do more than just write.\n\nThey need to understand the different client businesses and be able to create content that drives growth. That entails building strategies, knowing how to do content audits, understanding how to improve content for paid acquisition campaigns, coming up with distribution strategies for amplification, etc.\n\nHopefully that makes sense, and that’s why I’m trying to define the Content Marketing Specialist and Content Marketing Strategist roles. Yes the strategist is in charge of content strategy, but I want to make those competencies a bit more fleshed out and clear, and have milestones for specialists to complete in order to be promoted to a strategist. I’m also trying to understand how other agencies might create development paths for these type of roles.",

Our Growth Marketing Strategists are typically in charge of strategy\/client communication, unless it’s a content marketing only retainer, then our Content Marketing Strategists will also be in charge of strategy\/comms. This cuts out any unnecessary middle-person, so we can work more closely with the client and be much more strategic with our content.\n\nWe hire content marketing specialists and strategists instead of just writers because we specialize in B2B SaaS growth marketing, so we want our content marketers to be able to do more than just write.\n\nThey need to understand the different client businesses and be able to create content that drives growth. That entails building strategies, knowing how to do content audits, understanding how to improve content for paid acquisition campaigns, coming up with distribution strategies for amplification, etc.\n\nHopefully that makes sense, and that’s why I’m trying to define the Content Marketing Specialist and Content Marketing Strategist roles. Yes the strategist is in charge of content strategy, but I want to make those competencies a bit more fleshed out and clear, and have milestones for specialists to complete in order to be promoted to a strategist. I’m also trying to understand how other agencies might create development paths for these type of roles."
