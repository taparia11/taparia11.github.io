Outline the problems \/ opportunities we're trying to solve in 2021, for me this mapped to our OKRs which made it a bit easier\n3. Present a few different options for solving these -- we could hire two roles to focus deeply on X, or we could hire 1 person to do X &amp; Y, or we could outsource this part of Y. The options were helpful in thinking about trade-offs. This last piece was probably the most helpful :slightly_smiling_face: It's a red flag for snr leaders to see only one way to solve a problem, there are always multiple ways to accomplish anything, and showing that you thought through the tradeoffs of the different approaches will earn you a lot of trust.\ngood luck!",
