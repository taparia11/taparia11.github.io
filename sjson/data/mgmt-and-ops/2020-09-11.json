But that runs the risk of me doing her work, which my boss explicitly doesn’t want me to do.\n\nWe also have a pretty relaxed remote environment, where we’re not expected to be online during a hard schedule, so long as we get our work done within the scoped hours. I think there’s a little bit of time mgmt discipline on her end, and sometimes she kicks the can down the road knowing that our deadlines are usually EOM. Trying to tighten all that up.",

I’ve had some version of this conversation with her, and I think she has a big confidence issue (she second-guesses her work, then lingers on it).\n\nI tell her that I’m OK with imperfection in the interest of keeping the bigger project moving (I QC and edit her work anyhow). But that runs the risk of me doing her work, which my boss explicitly doesn’t want me to do.\n\nWe also have a pretty relaxed remote environment, where we’re not expected to be online during a hard schedule, so long as we get our work done within the scoped hours. I think there’s a little bit of time mgmt discipline on her end, and sometimes she kicks the can down the road knowing that our deadlines are usually EOM. Trying to tighten all that up."
