Plus, it can depend on how good a content leader your company can attract and what they might need to drive significant business results.\n\nAt NerdWallet, before I joined at early startup stage, I did homework and realized that content could play a major role in growing the business, but whoever led content would need a seat at the exec table. That way, they’d have full access to the business and be able to leverage that visibility while they shaped content as a function.\n\nSo even before I applied, I'd decided that I wouldn't join unless I could negotiate a bigger role than they'd advertised.\n\nMy pitch worked and I ended up serving on our exec team for my entire 7.5 years and running our content team as an independent function. I reported to the COO and later to the CEO. (Marketing was a separate function, run by someone else. Of course, our teams collaborated and communicated as needed.)\n\nI was recruited away, but I chose my successor, who inherited my seat on NerdWallet’s exec team and still runs content as an independent function. That content team now stands at about 120 FTEs.\n\nAt my current employer, we have separate marketing and editorial functions, which roll up to an operating partner who's the equivalent of a CMO. But she defers to me on running the editorial team, because she has no editorial experience. I don't mind reporting to her, because she's amazing.\n\nIf you're able to get a highly experienced content leader with a strong track record, that could affect how you organize. Like I was recruited for a head of content role at a public company and they offered to change the reporting structure and level if I'd be willing to take the job, so I wouldn't report to the CMO. If someone with less experience and less potential had taken the job, they would've kept it under the CMO. But they thought if I'd take the role, I could scale a much more significant operation to help build brand and drive the bottom line, possibly break out the content operations as a subsidiary.\n\nThat's just an example of the sort of optimizing that might happen, depending on the business and the talent.\n\nKey thing that's important for content folks to recognize: We are at a tipping point with content. More and more companies are seeing them as must-have roles as traditional marketing has lost effectiveness. Increasingly, there are opportunities for strong content leaders to pioneer or reshape roles, to play bigger parts in growing businesses. To do that, they need to increasingly think and operate like business leaders. How you gain such skills can vary, but you'd need them at exec level or C-level. Like some companies are creating chief content officer roles. If they live up to billing, that means those people must perform at C-level, not just be good from a content perspective, but from a business perspective as well.\n\nI highlight this, because sometimes people pattern-match unnecessarily or have self-limiting beliefs. To me, whoever drives strong business value earns more respect, and they can influence org structure and much more. Even if no one's ever done something before, that doesn't mean it's necessarily impossible.\n\n",
