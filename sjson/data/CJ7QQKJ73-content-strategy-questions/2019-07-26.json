But when you HAVE it, it's that something extra that makes your content memorable.\n\nLike a person with truly great style. You remember them because they stand out, they have that something extra. They capture and hold your attention.\n\nIt's probably fair to say voice and tone get talked about more than they matter because it's  hard to create a strong voice and tone if you don't naturally have one, but having a unique voice is part of a strong brand, when you have it, it kind of just makes everything easier, better, more memorable.",

For us, being opinionated is a very core part of our brand -- we distinguish when something is our opinion vs. generally accepted best practice. Employees are encouraged to form and state opinions. It's funny to see people in our Slack community pick this up as well, people frequently say \"This is my opinion\" before stating their position or even using that to frame the advice they are about to give.\n\nSo if you compare our brand to let's say HubSpot, I would say that for HubSpot it's more important that their voice be friendly than opinionated. Sure, they publish a lot of opinionated content, but it's not what makes their content memorable -- what makes it memorable is that it has this casual friendliness to it that works very well for their audience. And that friendliness is reflected in so many aspects of their brand, from calling their meetups \"HUGS\" to using bright friendly colors.\n\nIf the only place our company talked about being opinionated was in this little chart it would be 100% pointless. But  it appears in onboarding docs, we talk about opinions at all-hands meetings, we ask each other to clarify current opinions so in this context we're just saying \"here is how to express this aspect of our brand in writing\"",

He's suuuuuper opinionated but rarely clarifies that his guidance is just an opinion or pauses to give evidence for what informed his opinion. That's OK, it's on-brand for him, but that would be really off-brand for us. Both opinionated, but two very different ways of expressing it, and that's what I was trying to capture in the example here -- we make a point to clarify what is opinion vs. established best practice or evidence-backed and I think that's how we start to express the \"openness\". Strong opinions can shut down conversations, we want to express opinions in a way that makes it clear what we believe about the world, but keeps the dialogue open because we're open to change.",

Like \"here's a common belief that a lot our industry holds,\" and then your response is \"here's what we think, it's different, and here's why.\"\n\nAnd the key point is that your stance needs to be articulated throughout all your work?",

        "text": "Yeah, I think that's about right. Our product introduces a very different way of doing an old thing. So while we've convinced a core group of early users that it's the right way (and they LOVE it), we have a long road ahead of us to change an industry. We're often asking people to do things in a way that feels a little odd to them at first. So for us, it's important that every thing we put out there is opinionated and shows an awareness of that opinion. We can't afford to be sloppy or unconsidered in our thinking.\n\nWe talk about our product as being a highly opinionated product, one of our users calls it \"a state of mind\" :joy:\n\nSo again, it's not just random \"writing guidelines\" or an attempt to make our brand memorable for the sake of being memorable -- it's how we express our brand in writing.\n\nI've been a part of voice &amp; tone exercises before that were much more like \"How would we like to sound?\" and people are like \"we should use memes!\" and that's when it felt very pointless, it has to come from your brand, and your brand comes from your target market, positioning, etc.\n\nSo exactly what you said above -- it's how we articulate our stance. That stance is articulated in the product we're building, the way we run client engagements, who we see as our target market, and how we write.",
