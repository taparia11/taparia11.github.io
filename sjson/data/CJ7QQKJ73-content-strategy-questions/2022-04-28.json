I'm looking to create a business card handout with a QR code on it - can anyone advise what the best way of doing this is - design the business card as normal, embed the QR code into the design and print like any other business card? In terms of the QR code, any recommendations for QR code generators that can track who is engaging? I'm looking for one that integrates with HubSpot preferably :slightly_smiling_face: My end goal is to create some sort of landing page with links to resources, videos, guides etc, that can be constantly updated - I guess this is best done like any normal landing page, but using UTM tracking in the URL?
