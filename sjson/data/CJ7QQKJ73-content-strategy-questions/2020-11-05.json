        "text": "The prototype for consumer content marketing would be brands like REI. Great combination of brand content and educational resources, and great examples of distribution both online and offline (eg flyers sitting on store shelves showing you how to buy certain gear).\n\nThere are definitely differences in consumer products that are highly considered purchases (a new bike, life insurance, a mortgage, the right roof rack for your car, etc), versus purchases that are lower consideration (most consumer packaged goods\/consumables like groceries, basic clothing items, etc). Usually lower considered lifestyle purchases are more likely to invest in lifestyle content (eg great photography and lots of Instagram videos) as opposed to long-form web content that is more associated with content marketing.\n\nIf you look in the B2B space, so many of those purchases are heavier consideration that content marketing works well, and if the product can't inspire somebody on Instagram, it had better be really good at educating them in search or supporting outbound channels.\n\nFor earlier stage B2C companies I think the critical element is either using lifestyle content to build paid and referral channels (eg great Instagram ads and a social following), or deciding if you'll have better luck playing the long game on things like SEO and ranking for queries where buying your product helps solve the user's problem. That hard part is understanding how to manage your budget across those goals, which will be effective and over what time frame, and then balancing between doing enough testing but not over-investing in a channel that doesn't work.",

Great combination of brand content and educational resources, and great examples of distribution both online and offline (eg flyers sitting on store shelves showing you how to buy certain gear).\n\nThere are definitely differences in consumer products that are highly considered purchases (a new bike, life insurance, a mortgage, the right roof rack for your car, etc), versus purchases that are lower consideration (most consumer packaged goods\/consumables like groceries, basic clothing items, etc). Usually lower considered lifestyle purchases are more likely to invest in lifestyle content (eg great photography and lots of Instagram videos) as opposed to long-form web content that is more associated with content marketing.\n\nIf you look in the B2B space, so many of those purchases are heavier consideration that content marketing works well, and if the product can't inspire somebody on Instagram, it had better be really good at educating them in search or supporting outbound channels.\n\nFor earlier stage B2C companies I think the critical element is either using lifestyle content to build paid and referral channels (eg great Instagram ads and a social following), or deciding if you'll have better luck playing the long game on things like SEO and ranking for queries where buying your product helps solve the user's problem. That hard part is understanding how to manage your budget across those goals, which will be effective and over what time frame, and then balancing between doing enough testing but not over-investing in a channel that doesn't work."
