So in your intro video you can promise that “by the end of this course you’ll be able to [INSERT ACTIONABLE THING HERE]. (10x your email list, have a blueprint to start your business, set up bots that work and book meetings in your sleep)\n• If you want to use the course to collect emails, do it by having them sign up to create a login for the course portal instead of a typical gated content form. This gets extra points if you can offer them a certificate at the end for completing the course. \n&gt; Here's a few that Drift offers now as an example: <https:\/\/insider.drift.com\/certifications\/|https:\/\/insider.drift.com\/certifications\/>\n• It's also great if you can offer a certification that feels LinkedIn worthy, because then other people will see that certification on their peers profile and look into getting one themselves. \n• The last thing I'm a little bias towards since video is what I specialize in helping companies with—but I’ve seen companies build out full courses and not invest in video quality, only to have people turned off by this\/find that it makes the brand feel cheap. Then they end up having to go back and remake the whole course. So, invest in making the course feel high quality from the get-go. ",
