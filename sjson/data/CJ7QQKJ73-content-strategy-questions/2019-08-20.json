        "text": "Very common! I ran the communications team at HubSpot and while we had some team members who did more content creation than others, if you're working in PR..you're doing content.\n\nI hired from both traditional PR as well as traditional content backgrounds. The PR folks are stronger on media strategy, pitching, integrating their work into a larger campaign launch. Content people tend to be better writers and do a better job working on executive bylines, creating speaking decks, stuff like that.\n\nI would just be clear on what you need most. It's not difficult to find people from both backgrounds who can do both PR &amp; CM, but if you need a great content creator to do some pitching -- hire a great CM. If you need who is strong on media relations\/PR strategy to write some content -- hire a PR person.",
