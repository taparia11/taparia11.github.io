        "text": "Hi, Camila! I was just working on something like this yesterday! At my company, we're in the midst of our budget cycle now. In my budget presentation, I will have to discuss our organic traffic historical results, what progress we've made since we re-engaged our SEO agency a few months ago, what I expect we can achieve by the end of this fiscal year, and what I think we could hit next fiscal year. So I pulled data from our Google Analytics and created a spreadsheet with a pivot line chart to plot our fiscal year organic traffic from two years ago, last year, this year so far, and projections for the rest of this year and all of next year (projections are in dotted lines). Our site traffic is very cyclical, so I've plotted it out by month to show our traffic for each fiscal year, e.g., comparing Dec 2019 vs Dec 2020 vs Dec 2021. Knowing which months are typically higher or lower helped me estimate what I think our future results realistically could be if we continue our SEO work. \n\nMy budget request is to make the case for securing funds again to keep our engagement with our SEO agency partner, so I need to demonstrate that the work we've done so far is showing improvement already YoY, and that we can't afford to not keep spending money on this critical task. \n\nAs you're thinking about the traffic data you're pulling together and all of your \"it depends\" factors, think about the story you need to tell to make your point. I highly recommend \"Storytelling With Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals\" by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic. That book will help you think about how to boil down your data to visually tell the story you need to tell to your audience to provide context and get them to focus on what matters.",

In my budget presentation, I will have to discuss our organic traffic historical results, what progress we've made since we re-engaged our SEO agency a few months ago, what I expect we can achieve by the end of this fiscal year, and what I think we could hit next fiscal year. So I pulled data from our Google Analytics and created a spreadsheet with a pivot line chart to plot our fiscal year organic traffic from two years ago, last year, this year so far, and projections for the rest of this year and all of next year (projections are in dotted lines). Our site traffic is very cyclical, so I've plotted it out by month to show our traffic for each fiscal year, e.g., comparing Dec 2019 vs Dec 2020 vs Dec 2021. Knowing which months are typically higher or lower helped me estimate what I think our future results realistically could be if we continue our SEO work. \n\nMy budget request is to make the case for securing funds again to keep our engagement with our SEO agency partner, so I need to demonstrate that the work we've done so far is showing improvement already YoY, and that we can't afford to not keep spending money on this critical task. \n\nAs you're thinking about the traffic data you're pulling together and all of your \"it depends\" factors, think about the story you need to tell to make your point. I highly recommend \"Storytelling With Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals\" by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic. That book will help you think about how to boil down your data to visually tell the story you need to tell to your audience to provide context and get them to focus on what matters."
