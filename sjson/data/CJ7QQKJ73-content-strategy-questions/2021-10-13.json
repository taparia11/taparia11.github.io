However, I'd probably start with an agency to come up with a comprehensive content strategy even in that case.\n\nIf you're more a one-man show and it feels like that would stretch you to breaking point, I'd suggest going with a content agency. At least in my experience with clients, you'll probably end up having content published more consistently without bogging down projects you can't hire out. That's especially going to help you if you're in charge of repurposing content for multiple channels — getting the long-form pieces written first, without you spending 1 or more days on each, could streamline your process significantly.\n\nAn agency would also be helpful in terms of calculating what you get for exact dollars, at least in terms of deliverables (IMO).\n\nIf it were me, I'd probably ask questions like:\n\n• *Are you more concerned with building exponential traffic\/leads to one source (website, YouTube, email, etc.) or with having existing content on a larger variety of sources?* If he's just hoping to have a lot more organic traffic to the site, then the budget should go to long-form content creation, based on your industry. But if he wants to engage a different channel first, that impacts the budget and whom you work with a LOT.\n• *What timeline are you comfortable to wait for results?* If he wants something fast, you'll need to look at paid traffic, but if he's willing to give 3-6 months+ to the efforts, long-form SEO content could work well.\nI hope this is helpful!",

However, I'd probably start with an agency to come up with a comprehensive content strategy even in that case.\n\nIf you're more a one-man show and it feels like that would stretch you to breaking point, I'd suggest going with a content agency. At least in my experience with clients, you'll probably end up having content published more consistently without bogging down projects you can't hire out. That's especially going to help you if you're in charge of repurposing content for multiple channels — getting the long-form pieces written first, without you spending 1 or more days on each, could streamline your process significantly.\n\nAn agency would also be helpful in terms of calculating what you get for exact dollars, at least in terms of deliverables (IMO).\n\nIf it were me, I'd probably ask questions like:\n\n"
