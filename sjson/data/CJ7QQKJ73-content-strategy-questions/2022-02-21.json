        "text": "hey! Yes—we did this at Drift, and I helped Privy set up something similar with Shopify Compass. Here are my thoughts based on what I’ve seen:\n\n1. With Drift, we made it a certificate course, so at the end you’d become Drift Certified. It can never hurt to measure pipeline\/trial sign ups, but I would definitely view it as a brand awareness play, and it works very well. If the brand isn’t a household name yet, then something more like Privy Masterclass would probably work better, as opposed to a certificate course. The goal is to just add as much value as possible so you become the place people go to get better at their job.\n2. The answer here is both. Absolutely use the platform in the course material AS LONG AS it’s not sales-y. E.g if you’re Privy, and you’re teaching Email List Growth, you can teach how to create effective pop-ups, that just so happen to use the platform to do it. It’s best if that best practice info could be transferrable to other platforms though.\n\n3.\n• <https:\/\/www.shopify.com\/learn|Shopify Learn> has somme AMAZING brand courses. \n• Here’s <https:\/\/insider.drift.com\/certifications\/|Drift Insider> if you want an example that provides you with a certificate\n• <https:\/\/www.privy.com\/masterclass|Privy Masterclass> is a great one that’s focused just on delivering value\n• As a bonus, I’d also recommend checking out courses where the course itself is the actual business. I help run <https:\/\/www.fulltimefilmmaker.com|Fulltime Filmmaker> &amp; <https:\/\/davegerhardt.com\/university\/|DGMG> if you have any questions about courses\/communities that _are_ the actual business. I find these to be great role-models since the course is the product, it better be a damn good course! FTF in particular is a great example of a very structured course. Something this structured definitely requires more of an investment BUT its such strong content that the course itself is a multi-million dollar business. ",

It can never hurt to measure pipeline\/trial sign ups, but I would definitely view it as a brand awareness play, and it works very well. If the brand isn’t a household name yet, then something more like Privy Masterclass would probably work better, as opposed to a certificate course. The goal is to just add as much value as possible so you become the place people go to get better at their job."

E.g if you’re Privy, and you’re teaching Email List Growth, you can teach how to create effective pop-ups, that just so happen to use the platform to do it. It’s best if that best practice info could be transferrable to other platforms though.\n\n3.\n"
