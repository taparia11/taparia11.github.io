We would love to work with a GOOD, well respected one, but I suspect many of these are more like spam. We’re looking for someone who could help get the product into the hands of relevant influencer\/health\/lifestyle bloggers to do reviews, so sort of like micro PR and partnerships. Any recommendations for a good sponsored content or micro-influencer marketing platform or agency?"
