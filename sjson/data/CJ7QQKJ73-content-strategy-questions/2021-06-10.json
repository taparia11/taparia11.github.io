        "text": "<@U01AHL8AGBB> we call this \"the tyranny of jargon\" because all of us practitioners despise these terms but they end up becoming kind of a lingua franca for marketing conversations. we've honestly resorted at times to calling content \"stuff and things\" - lol. I think it's always important to try to move away from using terms like this if they risk damage to the program. It's a big reason I never call people \"users, targets or leads\" because you end up dehumanizing them and not thinking about their needs. They become proxies for the things you are incentivized by. Which brings me to the second point several people have made here - no matter what you call these things, it's all about what the person needs in the moment. What's going to help them? While i understand the motivation to tie some of these things to revenue, its is incredibly difficult to tie conversation creation to revenue. Marketing is a conversation and sales is something different. There's an important handoff that everyone needs to be clear on - but a great story isn't great because you can tie it to revenue. We often see, in the best scenarios, that it takes between 3-7 sessions before someone goes deeper than articles - so what can you learn about what's happening in those 3-7 sections. What channels are working, what kind of channel marketing is working, what elements of what types of stories seem to resonate (editorial metadata). This learning agenda is an often ignored value when people are interacting with your company around ideas. We always encourage people to spend more time articulating the value of what you can learn in these interactions that isn't tied to narrow KPIs\/outcomes.",

                                "text": " we call this \"the tyranny of jargon\" because all of us practitioners despise these terms but they end up becoming kind of a lingua franca for marketing conversations. we've honestly resorted at times to calling content \"stuff and things\" - lol. I think it's always important to try to move away from using terms like this if they risk damage to the program. It's a big reason I never call people \"users, targets or leads\" because you end up dehumanizing them and not thinking about their needs. They become proxies for the things you are incentivized by. Which brings me to the second point several people have made here - no matter what you call these things, it's all about what the person needs in the moment. What's going to help them? While i understand the motivation to tie some of these things to revenue, its is incredibly difficult to tie conversation creation to revenue. Marketing is a conversation and sales is something different. There's an important handoff that everyone needs to be clear on - but a great story isn't great because you can tie it to revenue. We often see, in the best scenarios, that it takes between 3-7 sessions before someone goes deeper than articles - so what can you learn about what's happening in those 3-7 sections. What channels are working, what kind of channel marketing is working, what elements of what types of stories seem to resonate (editorial metadata). This learning agenda is an often ignored value when people are interacting with your company around ideas. We always encourage people to spend more time articulating the value of what you can learn in these interactions that isn't tied to narrow KPIs\/outcomes."
