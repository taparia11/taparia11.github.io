        "text": "Hi all, former content marketer here, turned founder (<http:\/\/teamgather.co|teamgather.co>), now building out our startup's content marketing program. We have a concept we want to test out which includes hiring our target audience to write blog pieces for us. Here's what we're thinking:\n\n`We want to contract Heads of People Operations (our target customer) to write posts about the people operations programs they're building at their own companies. Many of these folks are good writers and know the blog post format well, but we expect a mixed bag with a lot of editing on our end. Plus they are busy FT workers. I have a budget of $10K over the next 9 months to test this out, make the most of it, and find out if this is going to be worthwhile for us.`\n\nQuestions for you:\n• How would you go about allocating the money and setting rates for these folks?\n• How would you formalize some of these processes here so this doesn't become too chaotic? (just looking to avoid common pitfalls really)\nThanks in advance for the help! Love this community.",
