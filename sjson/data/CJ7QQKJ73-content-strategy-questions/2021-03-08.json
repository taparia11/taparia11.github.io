The good news is you have nowhere to go but up! :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nThe unfortunate news is that your managers who expect high engagement on the five-year anniversary should probably reset their expectations. If subscribers and followers aren’t already engaging with your content, that’s not going to magically change just because you’re celebrating a milestone.\n\nKeep in mind that what’s important to your team internally at the company isn’t necessarily important to your customers. Put yourself in their shoes. Pretend you’re a customer and ask yourself: “Why should I care that BuyPower is celebrating an anniversary? What does that mean to me?”\n\nMy suggestion is to focus on customers for the anniversary — not on the company.\n\nFor example, can you find three thrilled customers and shoot video of each of them talking about how their life has changed since having easier access to electricity? You could put a two- or three-minute version of each video on YouTube and a tighter edit of 30 or 45 seconds on Facebook. Capture video of people talking naturally about your company.\n\nUse leading questions such as:\n\n• What do you love about BuyPower?\n• How has easier access to electricity brightened your life?\n• Describe your life today compared to five years ago before BuyPower?\nGet them to talk about how they feel more “energized” or “charged.” Let your customers see themselves in your content.",
