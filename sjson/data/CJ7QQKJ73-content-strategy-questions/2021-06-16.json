        "text": "Hi <@UMQASRN1W>! We're actually about to do this with an event at Casted (in September). The start of our plan is to:\n• Turn the sessions into a new podcast that will start releasing the week after the event (the topic of the conference aligns to a new show we’re creating). Instead of releasing all of the videos at once, we’re going to drip them out in podcast forms because most of our sessions will be conversational-based and it gives us an opportunity to further promote the speakers after the event\n• Create blog copy out of the sessions (and identify topics from the sessions that will drive future conversations and content)\n• Create audio\/video clips to promote the new podcast (and the next event)\n• Use discussion topics that come up for fodder for future conversations and content that will live in our slack community (and we will then reuse\/repurpose into more future content. I’m a sucker for reusing and repurposing if you can’t tell)\n• Use sessions for enablement and education\nBecause we're in the throws of planning, I know what you're going through, so good luck on your planning. And I'd be happy to chat further if you want to brainstorm other ideas!",
