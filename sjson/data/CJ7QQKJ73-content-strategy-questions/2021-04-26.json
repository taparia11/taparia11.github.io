Maybe it’s more useful to dedicate a section of your portfolio to describing what kind of values are important to you and your writing. Then you could tackle the question of why your employment has been short at some companies in a more general sense: they didn’t always align with your values. And go on to describe the kind of companies you’d like to work with. This is still transparent without getting into the details of why they didn’t align with your values."
