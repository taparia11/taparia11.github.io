I’m the strategist - more focused on assigning topics, creating briefs, and looking at the results. I also jump in and write when we’re at capacity - which means I write daily. \n\nWe have one writer really focused on updating old content for SEO purposes, creating new TOF SEO content, and acting as our primary “final set of eyes.” More “long-form content.” She’s our newest hire and has been a great add. She came from a journalism background. \n\nWe also have a writer that is primarily “short-form” content. He works on email copy, product copy, and sales enablement copy. \n\nFinally I have a Visual Storyteller and a Marketing Coordinator on my team. The Visual Storyteller is our videographer and he has always remained on the content team. I’ve worked with him for three years and while I can’t give him a ton of technical feedback - we work extremely well together creating videos to rank in search, and telling a story. \n\nThe Marketing Coordinator handles social media and webinars. She’s moving more into a project coordinator position. \n\nI’m considering bringing on freelance writers in Q4 as my writers are extremely busy. Hoping to find one that understands our product and target audience.",

I’m the strategist - more focused on assigning topics, creating briefs, and looking at the results. I also jump in and write when we’re at capacity - which means I write daily. \n\nWe have one writer really focused on updating old content for SEO purposes, creating new TOF SEO content, and acting as our primary “final set of eyes.” More “long-form content.” She’s our newest hire and has been a great add. She came from a journalism background. \n\nWe also have a writer that is primarily “short-form” content. He works on email copy, product copy, and sales enablement copy. \n\nFinally I have a Visual Storyteller and a Marketing Coordinator on my team. The Visual Storyteller is our videographer and he has always remained on the content team. I’ve worked with him for three years and while I can’t give him a ton of technical feedback - we work extremely well together creating videos to rank in search, and telling a story. \n\nThe Marketing Coordinator handles social media and webinars. She’s moving more into a project coordinator position. \n\nI’m considering bringing on freelance writers in Q4 as my writers are extremely busy. Hoping to find one that understands our product and target audience."

                "text": "Pricing Freelance Projects is a book I've always wanted to write. On 30th July 2020, I'll release it. I posted a Twitter thread summarising my experience, learning and knowledge of pricing real-world freelancing services. And it took off. At the time of writing, the thread has received 36,500 likes and 10,900 retweets. My message has been seen 2.8 Million times by people. Its content has been re-worked and re-posted around the world. I’ve had countless messages of thanks for sharing my condensed version of 11 years in pricing freelance work. I’d already thought about writing a book on pricing for freelancers, but this response was the catalyst. Along with the wide-reaching positivity, my approach received questions too. More than I could keep up with in real-time. Many freelancers have asked for a level of expansion on my thinking and methods that would be better suited to a longer-form medium than Twitter. This was the moment that I decided I had to write this book. The good news is, I’ve got a lot more to say. Whether you’re thinking about going freelance, you’re a new freelancer or you’re a seasoned pro with years of experience behind you: Pricing is complex. Pricing is personal. . Pricing has layers. Pricing is fluid. Pricing is an art. I’ve made it my mission to understand pricing deeply to get paid what I’m worth throughout my freelancing career. And this mantra makes me a great living from freelancing year on year. Pricing Freelance Projects is not \"just another value-based pricing system\". This book shows you how to understand, raise and retain your value on a per-project basis. This book teaches you how to apply value realistically to know what to charge and get paid what you're worth. This book expands heavily on the Twitter thread that freelancers loved and provides answers to their questions. This book contains everything that I know about pricing freelance work. And there’s tons of value in it for you. The Plan. I've had Pricing Freelance Projects drafted for a while and the plan has always been to write it. The attention my writing on pricing has received recently has accelerated this process. Writing has already started. The book will be released for download on 30th July 2020. I'll provide updates between then and now as creation unfolds. Follow me as I write, edit and launch Pricing Freelance Projects on Twitter! <https:\/\/twitter.com\/tom_hirst>. Pre-Order Now. By clicking the \"I want this!\" button, you're locking in your copy of Pricing Freelance Projects for the special pre-order price of $19.

FAQ. Who is this book for exactly? Pricing Freelance Projects is for freelancers, people thinking about going freelance, consultants, small-agencies, entrepreneurs and solopreneurs. It's for designers, developers, writers, SEOs and more. It's for anyone who sells services or products to clients. While my vantage point of pricing is from a freelancing perspective, I've had feedback from people in each of these fields that my approach adds value. Does buying this book guarantee that I will make more money? Absolutely not. Pricing Freelance Projects is the story of my experiences and I don't guarantee that you will see the same level of success. Applying this knowledge requires individual effort and is dependant on your specific circumstances and other external factors. Got a specific question? Send an email to <mailto:hello@tomhirst.com|hello@tomhirst.com> with the details, I'll be happy to help. What Now? Now's your chance to guarantee your copy of Pricing Freelance Projects for a cheaper price.

But I've seen people from this channel vouch for AirTable, because there are some features that can help you better map out which posts will target which keywords. Pruning definitely helps! Definitely use Ahrefs though to make sure you're not not deleting any blogs with tons of backlinks.\n2. I don't have data to prove this, but I've read enough smart people say that URL structure matters to believe them. I always try to use a tiered URL structure like this, when possible. That said, it's okay to take a staged approach here. Prune first, restructure second.",
