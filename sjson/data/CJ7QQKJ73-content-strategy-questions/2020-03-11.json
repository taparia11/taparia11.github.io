I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts and experiences.\n\n*In general, what are your skills? Who do you report into? Any shifts or trends you've seen recently in hiring?*\n\nTo kick off the conversation, I can start: I hopped all over the content world, working as a lifestyle writer, an advertising copywriter, and a freelance journalist, before settling into content marketing, where I've spent the last 5-6 years. At my last job, I specialized in PR and running content-based campaigns (like writing an ebook and all the ad, email, and promotional copy that goes along with it). At my current job, campaigns falls under demand gen, so I'm focusing more on communications here. I currently report into the head of marketing, but I've recently talked to a few heads of marketing who structure things differently.\n\nCurious what you all have seen and if you have predictions for where content marketing is heading!",
