Do you all share a common metric (traffic, SEO, leads, MQLs) or do you each own a specific metric? I’m scaling our content team and our company is really obsessed with “MECE scopes” meaning each team member has full ownership of a clearly defined scope, which is defined by the needle you move (e.g. traffic\/MQLs\/SQLs) and not by the output (e.g. blog posts\/webinars). For context, sharing a screenshot of how I currently define the scope for the whole content team (only me at the moment.) I’m wondering what’s the best option to split these metrics and ownership and if anybody has some insights they can share?",
