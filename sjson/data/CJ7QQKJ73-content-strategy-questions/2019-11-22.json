Echoing what's been said, we start by explaining what's in it for them, the contributor. Our experts are primarily seller-doers who are top-line driven and have high utilization targets. They don't have a minute to waste so need to know what time they do spend on M&amp;BD activities will be worth it. So we tell them that\n\n\n1. Our research shows that thought leadership impacts most clients' buying decisions. \n2. Clients go to a firm's website to find that thought leadership--more often than trade publications, industry events, and other traditional sources of thought leadership. \n3. You're nobody until Google loves you. Search yourself (because your clients are). Do your search results reflect your expertise? If not, you need content. \n\nWe then try to streamline the content production process. For experts who don't have time to write, we ask for a 30-min interview with one of our writers, who will ghostwrite something for the expert to review. Also, repurposing content they are creating is another tactic (mentioned above).\n\nHope this helps!",
