It took a ton of therapy and coaching to get over the imposter syndrome related to my writing struggles. Some thoughts:\n\n• Some people have been intently writing on a daily basis for a very long time and can crank out words and sentences effortlessly. Don't compare yourself to these people, emulate them by writing free of constraints (aka journaling).\n• Be mindful of when you're writing something — anything, really. Notice when writing is as hard as you describe, and note when it feels effortless. Use journaling to examine what's different.\n• Read up on CBT and learn how to use mindfulness meditation to make sure your worries aren't standing in the way of progress. For example, I used to think\/say \"I suck at writing\" and learned to stop by saying \"I'm thinking I suck at writing.\" \nHope this is helpful.

And when I learned that he taught himself to write by copying The Great Gatsby word for word, I decided to give it a go. \n\nI’ve used the technique to help me quickly emulate the voice of a brand and experiment with different styles of content. For instance, I primarily work in the B2B space and found Patrick Lencioni’s storytelling approach to business writing innovative. So I copyworked a few chapters before attempting to write an ebook for Eventbrite. \n\nSo to answer your question: it depends on what you want or need to write. ",
