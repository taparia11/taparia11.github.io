My first thought is some type of NPS score where you ask for feedback on how helpful a user found the information (passively, with options at the bottom\/side of the page), if the content solved challenges: Y\/N, etc. Via google analytics you could also track video plays, PDF downloads, and % scroll depth on articles to measure engagement metrics. But aiming for a mix of active engagement (like downloads\/video plays) and sentiment (rating: 1-10, solved it: Y\/N, liked it: smile vs frown) could give you a good mix. Allowing input boxes based on people's feedback to gather more info is helpful when acting on sentiment data, but at a minimum lots of \"frowns\" or \"no's\" would highlight content not doing it's job in the user's mind.
