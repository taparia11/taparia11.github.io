Sure they all have a portfolio but I don’t know how long that really took them, and if others were involved etc. As a hiring manager, how do you *test* their ability to craft good content, within X amount of time? I’ve thought about asking them to do a paid assignment, and say ask them to be available at say time `X` for the assignment, and tell them to hand in the assignment at `X+4` so I know this is what the result is after `4 hours.` 4 hours is just an example, the time required\/given depends on the assignment of course.\n\nCurious to hear your approach to this. Thanks in advance!",

Great question :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nI think because we’re operating on 2 week sprints, it makes it easier to adjust especially in the case that someone gets sick. However when it comes to vacation\/holidays which allow us to prepare\/plan in advance, that gets taken into consideration during sprint planning. So, if we know someone will be gone for half the sprint (1 week), the work they commit to for that sprint is a weeks worth of work vs. 2.\n\nWhen it comes to the bigger holidays (I.e. we have a 2-3 week winter shut down), we give everyone that time off, but assign 2 work days worth of holiday homework. So, this could be write 2 blogs, clean up\/optimize ads, etc.\n\nHope that clarifies!",

I find that most quality content takes time to create and the best writers typically don't do the entire thing in one sitting (outline, draft, editing). Most decent writers can Google around for an hour or two researching a topic and come up with a decent post, but if you want something really stellar, they probably need a little more time (and leeway). For example, I've done test pieces where I reached out to experts for quotes to include in the post. However, this sort of \"above and beyond\" work isn't possible with a short deadline and won't allow a really talented content marketer to shine through. Also, I'm not sure if this is for a freelance position or full time, but if it's freelance, remember that most freelancers don't want a job because they appreciate time flexibility.
