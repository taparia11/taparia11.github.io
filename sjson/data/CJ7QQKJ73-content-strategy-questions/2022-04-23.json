                "text": "Interested in hearing about freelance pitching opportunities? Sign up for my $3\/month 2x per week newsletter.&nbsp;\nWhy do you do this?&nbsp;When I first became a full time freelancer, I added the hunt for calls for pitches and writing opportunities into my nightly routine, and at this point, I have it down to a science. Originally, I would just retweet all the ones I saw on Twitter, however, in July 2018, I decided that I would turn my findings into a newsletter to help spread the word to people who don&rsquo;t have the time to spend going through social media with a microscope.\nI can&rsquo;t afford $3\/month.&nbsp;$3 is the suggested rate. If you can&rsquo;t afford that, you pay what you can. If you can&rsquo;t afford anything, send me an email at . All the payment information is included in the signup form. If you can afford to pay more, that would be amazing as over 700 people currently receive this newsletter for free due to financial hardship.\nI see that you list some publications that are known for underpaying their writers\/treating their writers poorly. Are you endorsing this type of behavior?&nbsp;NO! However, I include these publications because it&rsquo;s not my place to decide who you pitch\/what you pitch. Unfortunately, being choosy about who you write for is a luxury. Just do your research into the publication and see if it&rsquo;s worth it. The freelance rates database from Contently and Who Pays Writers is helpful for that. Also look at the replies to the Tweets and see if people are mentioning the publication&rsquo;s poor reputation or patterns of bad practices.\nCan I post a link to a newsletter issue on my social media\/in my own newsletter?&nbsp;I&rsquo;d rather you didn&rsquo;t, but you can post a link to the subscription page.&nbsp;https:\/\/wordpress.us18.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=585878fc96a3f3261cbf319f0&amp;id=70d2f383b8\nI want to advertise my book\/class\/business\/podcast\/newsletter\/game\/etsy shop etc. in your newsletter. What should I do? Fill out this form on Calendly which has all the info regarding availability and pricing.\nI have an opportunity for freelancers that I want you to include. Great! I love when editors send me opportunities directly. FYI: All opportunities must be paid and I don&rsquo;t include fiction or poetry publications unless there are also non-fiction submission opportunities AND there is no submission fee. You can either use this form or send me an email at . If you prefer to send me an email, make sure to include: a description of the opportunity including pay rates; time commitment; qualifications (include whether you&rsquo;re open to new writers and if not, how many years of experience you require); any location restrictions (i.e is this only open to people in the US?); what kinds of samples applicants should send in their email and how many they should send; whether there&rsquo;s a deadline (it&rsquo;s easier for you if there is. You can always send me the opportunity again, but to keep your inbox manageable, I advise adding a deadline two to three weeks out); how people should get in touch; if there&rsquo;s something specific they should include in the subject line so you recognize their email; your name and your position with the company\/publication.\nCan I send you the opportunities I spot on social media? I&rsquo;m pretty thorough with my search, but if I&rsquo;ve sent out a newsletter that didn&rsquo;t include a call for pitches\/freelance opportunity that you saw, feel free to send it my way. \nI need some advice. Can you help me?&nbsp;I can try! Send me an email and I&rsquo;ll see what I can do. . Please google all your questions first as there are TONS of resources online.\nIs there an archive?&nbsp;No. Calls for pitches are often time sensitive or have deadlines for submission so an archive isn&rsquo;t that helpful. Also editors are constantly changing jobs\/getting hired\/laid off so often the old calls for pitches are useless. However, I include a link to the previous issue in every issue.\nI want to hire you for something. Are you open to that?&nbsp;ALWAYS AND FOREVER!\nI want to know what you&rsquo;ve learned from this experience: READ THIS!
