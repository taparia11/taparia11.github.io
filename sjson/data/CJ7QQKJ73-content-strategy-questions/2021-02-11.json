How long will the video be? What are the main \"beats\" the product team wants you to hit with the content? How much time will need to be devoted to the company's branding segment (is this standard across all videos, so you don't have to write it? or are you responsible for this too?)? How much time will need to be devoted for a CTA screen at the end? How many cameras will be used during filming (usually two or three—front, above, close up freehand)? Will some close up and overhead work be filmed separately and then patched in during editing (if so, you may need to create multiple scripts)? And then, once you know all this information, it becomes mostly a math problem. A 5min video with a 15 second brand intro and 15 second CTA screen at the end means you'd have 4:45 to cover X number of features. Break it down, write it up, separate the script (if necessary), and give it to the product team for edits. I usually aim for 150-160 words per minute—if your speaker is going faster than 160, it's usually too fast for a video audience.\n\nThe problem with video scripts is that people read faster than they speak when they're in a conversation. (You can read 200+ words a minute, but speaking that quickly would make someone sound very, very nervous.) So it is likely that your product team will read your script and say that it's too short, and that your acting talent will read faster from the prompter cards than they would if speaking off the cuff. Be prepared to push back a bit if you're told it's too short. You want your script to sound like real people talking about a product, not a race to cram stuff into the script.",

The first is \"our ideal client\" and the second is akin to \"meh, we don't hate this client.\" We refer to the \"ideal client\" occasionally, but the persona is such an ingrained part of our messaging, we use it more as a training tool for new staff. However, we use our \"meh, we don't hate this client\" all the time. We use it when we are looking for reasons to NOT take on a client. If a potential client doesn't even meet the \"meh, we don't hate this client\" standards, we pass them along to another agency. It's an on-going team joke to go into the file and add comments or qualities to the \"meh\" persona. The additions are always funny, and some of the things I have to remove, but a few stay in the persona because they're so perfect. I've also had a blast changing up the \"people\" by using the site <https:\/\/thispersondoesnotexist.com\/> For awhile, \"Meh\" was Joe the weather guy from American Ninja Warrior. This probably isn't answering your question ...\n\nI guess my intent is that personas are only valuable if you use them. If they're not something your team is going to get value from, find a method that will hold utility.",

The first is \"our ideal client\" and the second is akin to \"meh, we don't hate this client.\" We refer to the \"ideal client\" occasionally, but the persona is such an ingrained part of our messaging, we use it more as a training tool for new staff. However, we use our \"meh, we don't hate this client\" all the time. We use it when we are looking for reasons to NOT take on a client. If a potential client doesn't even meet the \"meh, we don't hate this client\" standards, we pass them along to another agency. It's an on-going team joke to go into the file and add comments or qualities to the \"meh\" persona. The additions are always funny, and some of the things I have to remove, but a few stay in the persona because they're so perfect. I've also had a blast changing up the \"people\" by using the site "
