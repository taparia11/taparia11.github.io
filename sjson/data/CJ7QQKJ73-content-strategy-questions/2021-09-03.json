Conventional wisdom says it's ideal not to have any one client accounting for more than 20% of gross revenue, because it's a risk.  If you have a few whale clients, it's a much bigger gut punch if one leaves, and you wind up redefining your practice to cater to the whales, rather than to cater to broader growth.\n\nInasmuch as the metaphor works, the question becomes one of short term and long term risk.  Ignoring new content to keep the whales going is a short term payoff with long term risk, whereas the other strategy has more short term risk and long term payoff.  Assuming you can't address both, that is.",

Conventional wisdom says it's ideal not to have any one client accounting for more than 20% of gross revenue, because it's a risk.  If you have a few whale clients, it's a much bigger gut punch if one leaves, and you wind up redefining your practice to cater to the whales, rather than to cater to broader growth.\n\nInasmuch as the metaphor works, the question becomes one of short term and long term risk.  Ignoring new content to keep the whales going is a short term payoff with long term risk, whereas the other strategy has more short term risk and long term payoff.  Assuming you can't address both, that is."

        "text": "At Eventbrite in 2016, we were three content marketing managers and a managing editor doing it all in-house. A year in and we were partnering with other brands to collaborate and share duties, some written entirely by Eventbrite’s team, some written by the partner’s. Some time after that, if I recall correctly, we started to lean on contract writers. By 2018, the three content marketing managers were purely strategist working with a pool of 4-5 contract writers, managing a few contributors, and aligning strategies with regional content strategists who had either employed an agency or contractors. Between 2019-2020, an agency dedicated to case studies, another doing syndication, and one tackling translation\/localization were added to the mix. \n\nThere was never a clear cut segmentation of what work was entrusted to whom. The pool of writers would get developed to the point I was able to lean on a few to handle an entire ebook — research, outline, draft, and all — if needed. \n\nThe key to unlocking growth has already been said. But to put a different spin on it, content marketing used to be a blue ocean strategy. I vividly recall publishing a blog post to the Eventbrite blog on a Tuesday afternoon and see it ranked #1 on Google Wednesday morning. \n\nThat’s literally impossible today.

A year in and we were partnering with other brands to collaborate and share duties, some written entirely by Eventbrite’s team, some written by the partner’s. Some time after that, if I recall correctly, we started to lean on contract writers. By 2018, the three content marketing managers were purely strategist working with a pool of 4-5 contract writers, managing a few contributors, and aligning strategies with regional content strategists who had either employed an agency or contractors. Between 2019-2020, an agency dedicated to case studies, another doing syndication, and one tackling translation\/localization were added to the mix. \n\nThere was never a clear cut segmentation of what work was entrusted to whom. The pool of writers would get developed to the point I was able to lean on a few to handle an entire ebook — research, outline, draft, and all — if needed. \n\nThe key to unlocking growth has already been said.
