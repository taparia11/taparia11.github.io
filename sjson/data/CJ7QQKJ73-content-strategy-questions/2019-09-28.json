But I want them to see how its culture is applicable to distributed teams with a large portion of remote colleagues. So I was hoping to find material written to that sort of persona. The distributed company persona, reserved about culture change but open to learning more. It's a bit of a stretch\/hard to find anything that isn't a quick list in a Forbes article. I'm just going to write a contextualizing paragraph that connects the dots &amp; include links to the remote resources CMCG mentioned :]",
