As I started writing my response below, it became obvious that this would be an awesome podcast episode.\n\n1. *top left: How do we add more conversions vs is that the right thing to do for this piece?* It might be that converting the customer is not the goal at the level. It may be super high traffic and be functioning for brand awareness. This is the case for the <https:\/\/dispatch.m.io\/unified-comms-influencers-2020\/|influencers infographics> we do at Mio each year. The goal is securing partnerships (writers, investment, guest posts, technical resource to lean on for quotes, potential integrations).\nIf it's not this type of article and just isn't converting, look at the intent. We have an article about deleting chats in microsoft teams. Are they our immediate customer? Absolutely not. But might they be in a year's time? Yes. So the \"conversion\" changes. We don't want to drive an install but we might prefer to collect their email _or direct them to another article that has a high conversion rate._<https:\/\/dispatch.m.io\/unified-comms-influencers-2020\/| >\n2. *bottom right: How can we get more relevant eyes on this article?* In this case, this is the _another article that has a high conversion rate_ I referenced above. So an easy win is to redirect the high traffic, low conversion traffic here. Sometimes that's all it needs. Sending a 100,000 view article per month to a 25% CVR article works wonders.
