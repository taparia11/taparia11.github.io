        "text": "There are so many reasons that your open rate could be going down. If your list has been growing, you can naturally expect your open rate to decline. You should also expect a certain amount of list churn over time as folks move email addresses, switch jobs, and generally become inactive for whatever reason. Your acquisition sources can also lead to open rate decline (i.e. are you running a lot of gated content campaigns that require an email registration?) As mentioned elsewhere in this thread, you can simply purge the subscribers that don’t open regularly and —  BOOM — your open rate will increase. But it’s a vanity metric at that point; it’s easy to manipulate by only sending to the folks that regularly open.\n\nSo you may need to do some more analysis to determine whether to run a re-engagement campaign, purge inactive subscribers, evaluate acquisition sources, or something else. If you’re not already practicing good list hygiene, I’d start there. There’s some good advice from Chad White, my former teammates at Litmus (couple examples <https:\/\/www.litmus.com\/blog\/how-to-manage-the-3-kinds-of-inactive-email-subscribers\/|here> and <https:\/\/blogs.oracle.com\/marketingcloud\/understanding-and-optimizing-the-6-stages-of-the-email-subscriber-lifecycle|here>) and great examples on <https:\/\/reallygoodemails.com\/|Really Good Emails>.",
