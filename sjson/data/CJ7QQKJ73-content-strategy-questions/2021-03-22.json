Since I use 3rd part apps for scheduling post I am able to oversee them when they go live and fine tune them with tags if needed.\n\nI am on the phone a lot. This means I am diving into IG stories, Reels and engagement from the audience. I generally do this 3 times a day. Morning, Afternoon, Early evening. In between this I am creating content."

The advice above is great, especially agree with <@U016BDEQ40J> because that’s where 100% pure freelancers can get caught up the most. But you also have strength where perhaps those with in-house content marketing experience don’t, and that’s in really really high-quality writing and a maturity in the way you request, accept, and synthesize feedback from key stakeholders. You should also lean heavily on domain expertise that perhaps others won’t have. I find freelancers tend to ramp more quickly as well, since they’re used to adjusting to new clients, new projects, new styles of working and have their own process for getting stuff done. So if they’re looking for someone who can ramp fast because their content needs are immediate, that can be a big selling point.",
