I'm supposed to also manage the SEO agency, who do 2 articles per month. As is often the case, the articles they create are generic \"5 ways to do X\" type blog posts which I'm not sure what to do with and aren't really aligned with the type of content we want to create.\n\nShould I ask the client to renegotiate the contract with the agency so they don't waste efforts producing content, or do the best I can with the situation and try to coach\/edit their articles as best I can? Curious to hear what others have done in this situation. Thanks!",

I'm supposed to also manage the SEO agency, who do 2 articles per month. As is often the case, the articles they create are generic \"5 ways to do X\" type blog posts which I'm not sure what to do with and aren't really aligned with the type of content we want to create.\n\nShould I ask the client to renegotiate the contract with the agency so they don't waste efforts producing content, or do the best I can with the situation and try to coach\/edit their articles as best I can? Curious to hear what others have done in this situation. Thanks!"

Are these in-house or freelance writers? If they're in-house, putting their checklists in ClickUp too may simplify things.\n\nFrom a usability standpoint, something I did for my team (not for briefs, but for training guides) was take everything we had in docs and put it into Google Slides presentations. It was some work for sure, but it made the presentation cleaner, less cluttered, and more user-friendly.\n\nHope that helps!"
