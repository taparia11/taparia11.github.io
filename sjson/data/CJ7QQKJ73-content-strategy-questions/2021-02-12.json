For that I'm looking for more best practices. I know the blogs of <https:\/\/www.intercom.com\/blog\/marketing\/|Intercom> and <https:\/\/lattice.com\/library|Lattice> already. :slightly_smiling_face:\n• *Do you know more blogs which work like libraries as a good exmple?*\nLooking forward to your suggestions :raised_hands:",

(I ask, because study after study shows that women are asked to \"prove\" themselves in job interviews at a significant rate over men. That's not saying men aren't, but that women are asked to prove themselves at a much higher rate.)\n2. If the person is a cultural fit, wouldn't that be more important than a track record of the exact skills you need? You can teach skills like writing very easily. If the person is bright and meshes very well with your team, I feel like you already have your answer.",

If you're going to use an algorithm to sort through resumes, ensure that it has a proven track record for not being racist or sexist (as almost all of them do, so you'll have to look diligently). Additionally, have an in-house internship programs that 1. pays, 2. is online, and 3. specifically recruits and hires diverse interns to build future full-time hires and leaders of tomorrow. Also, be a place where non-male, non-whites, and non-able-bodied people want to work—have diversity in a significant portion of your leadership positions (50% or higher).

Beyond the board, if there aren't 5+ non-white males in a 10-person company meeting, you're probably not going to be an attractive company for a diverse candidate to work for.  They might take the job, but if you don't show a continued commitment to improving DEI and listening to your non-white able-bodied male employees, they will leave quickly to find a company that is actually dedicated. You have to walk the walk and talk the talk. I worked for a company once that said it was \"focused on DEI\" ... lol ... it was focused on saying they were focused on DEI. Don't be that place.
