Currently, we don't use all Agile pieces, but have daily standups and retrospectives and use sprints for internal projects (once a week, four-hour blocks). Only two of our clients use sprints, though, so we rarely use that terminology when talking about client projects. I think at some point we tried to use sprints with all of our client projects (before I worked here), but it sounds like trying to get every project on a set structure just became impossible. Heck, we can't even get all of our clients to buy into our project management software, so we find ourselves manually submitting tickets on their behalf. Long way to say that I like it but we're not fully immersed in it—we pick and choose.",

My current agency has a \"buffet\" style relationship with the agile framework, so I don't use sprints as much as I did in my previous gig. Currently, we don't use all Agile pieces, but have daily standups and retrospectives and use sprints for internal projects (once a week, four-hour blocks). Only two of our clients use sprints, though, so we rarely use that terminology when talking about client projects. I think at some point we tried to use sprints with all of our client projects (before I worked here), but it sounds like trying to get every project on a set structure just became impossible. Heck, we can't even get all of our clients to buy into our project management software, so we find ourselves manually submitting tickets on their behalf. Long way to say that I like it but we're not fully immersed in it—we pick and choose."
