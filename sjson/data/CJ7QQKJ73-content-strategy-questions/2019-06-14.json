I would assume it’s right on the edge of some quality filter and it flips back and fourth depending on which way the wind is blowing.\nThat, OR it’s an anomaly in the Ahrefs data as they add and delete keywords all the time with low to no search volume base don their sampling.\n\n- It’s likely because the majority of keywords aren’t in “stable” positions. They’re all in the 11-100 category which probably means many of them keep dropping out",

Our company has a number of strategic business partners that our product integrates with and solves different problems for the same customers. But while we are business partners, from a content perspective we compete for keywords and rankings. Anyone else in this kind of position? I want to collaborate with the content person on our partner’s company, but I don’t want to spook or antagonize them-or the business partnership. Am I over-thinking this?",

Think about a company like HubSpot where they have partnerships with hundreds of marketing consultants and martech vendors, all competing for the same pool of marketing related keywords, but still frequently do co-marketing together.
