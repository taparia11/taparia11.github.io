        "text": "<@UUY24HLUW> for your first question I do regret not putting the stat in the title... when I wrote the title originally I didn’t put it in because Hubspot already has a similar case study, but they don’t go into other stats like why list posts are better to update, etc. As for how much time it took... well a lot! Mostly because I didn’t really know what stats I wanted to look at. For example, I was hoping to see some kind of correlation between updating pieces and back links, but there really wasn’t any so I ended up throwing it out. However I was able to finish the entire thing in one week (research and writing the post). So while it’s time consuming, it’s definitely doable! Your third question is one I’m still working on... I think it really depends on the case study\/data study you’re doing. I usually just try to use free data available. Try to start with the problem you want to explore and work backwards. For example, my new obsession is what I can do to attract more links. So what I think I’ll probably do is gather like 20 of the top marketing websites and put the URLs in Ahrefs. Then I’ll sort them by most linked to pages and look for any correlations I can. So I’m not really looking to create one stat but rather analyzing a problem and seeing what trends surface. I actually did a round up post of a few content marketers asking how they’ve created original data and some of them went deep into tools they use for data pieces.

So, you will need to update only the high-performing ones regularly. And, for the rest, you can try and consolidate them. Companies like Ahrefs have about 200+ blogs, which they keep updating every now and then. In fact, you can even have a content audit to see where you stand and I would strongly recommend taking out the non-performing ones. This way, you will narrow down on your niche.",

And, for the rest, you can try and consolidate them. Companies like Ahrefs have about 200+ blogs, which they keep updating every now and then. In fact, you can even have a content audit to see where you stand and I would strongly recommend taking out the non-performing ones. This way, you will narrow down on your niche."
