Mostly, this has to do with massive workload expectations that they think should be very inexpensive. One pain point I often address is, \"You need to match the amount of work you contract out to the budget you _actually_ have.\"\n\nAlong the lines of what <@U01HEQWRG0G> refers to above, we deal with a lot of brands who don't really have a logical idea of what matters most. For instance, they want vanity traffic metrics — but then don't really understand why they're not producing sales as a result of publishing only loosely-related content.\n\nI also see a lot of brands who have gotten wildly disparate, _bad_ advice. One client literally demanded we spend all our time on backlink building to 8 key articles on their site, which we did successfully for three months, only to literally back out of his 12-month contract because it wasn't \"going fast enough.\" His problems weren't us, but rather having gotten bad advice about how effective backlink building would be, and how fast it would work.\n\nIn terms of strategy for long-form blog content, another issue we see is too many pieces spread out over way too many topics. I will say that we work with primarily B2C\/D2C brands, so this may be different for B2B, but for a new library of content, we see results FAR and above when our clients publish is only one narrow category of content for 3-6 months before spreading out.\n\nFor instance, we work with a functional medicine clinic that does telehealth work throughout the US. They were publishing on everything from the benefits of not drinking too much alcohol to why PEMF therapy is effective. So, we picked ONE condition they frequently treated (IBS) and began building out content specifically related to that one condition. They're now competing with Healthline, MedicalNewsToday, and WebMD for major keywords that they'd never had a shot at when they were publishing with their old strategy.\n\nI could probably go on forever, but I'll leave you with that! :smile:",

One client literally demanded we spend all our time on backlink building to 8 key articles on their site, which we did successfully for three months, only to literally back out of his 12-month contract because it wasn't \"going fast enough.\" His problems weren't us, but rather having gotten bad advice about how effective backlink building would be, and how fast it would work.\n\nIn terms of strategy for long-form blog content, another issue we see is too many pieces spread out over way too many topics. I will say that we work with primarily B2C\/D2C brands, so this may be different for B2B, but for a new library of content, we see results FAR and above when our clients publish is only one narrow category of content for 3-6 months before spreading out.\n\nFor instance, we work with a functional medicine clinic that does telehealth work throughout the US. They were publishing on everything from the benefits of not drinking too much alcohol to why PEMF therapy is effective. So, we picked ONE condition they frequently treated (IBS) and began building out content specifically related to that one condition. They're now competing with Healthline, MedicalNewsToday, and WebMD for major keywords that they'd never had a shot at when they were publishing with their old strategy.\n\nI could probably go on forever, but I'll leave you with that!
