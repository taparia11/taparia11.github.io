Working with a “lean team” while being pulled in multiple different directions yourself can be very frustrating.\n\nI, ultimately, made the decision (and it was a little thrust upon me) to be final approver for all content on a small team. I think the biggest lesson learned was that, even if you’re a final approver, all responsibility doesn’t fall on you to make sure every piece is perfect. It still takes teamwork, even if you’re a final approver. And people who are not strong writers (yet!) should still be expected to help in the process. Here’s what helped me:\n\n1. Implement self-editing into your content process. This can be done really well using checklists that include things like: \n    a.  Run your writing through the Grammarly app. \n    b. Check your writing against the company style guide. \n    c. Read your work out loud.\nI have a few different checklists I’ve used in the past if you’re interested in seeing those.\n\n2. Implement peer-editing into your content process. Before any piece of writing falls on your desk, it needs to be looked at by another writer\/editor\/marketer.\n\n3. Now, this is important one that adds time, but IS SO IMPORTANT….Have the content piece by reviewed again once it’s in staging. If it’s web copy, review it once more once it’s on the website in staging. If it’s a report, review it all again after the final copy is in the report design.\n\nDepending on the piece, I’ve sometimes left this in-design review to another trusted colleague, mostly because I’ve been very close to it up to this point, but for larger projects, I always review it here, too.\n\n4. If you don’t have a project\/content management system to track all of this, it’s really helpful for accountability and visbility.\n\nIf your small team is producing more and more content, it will most likely begin to lengthen the time it takes to produce a piece because you’re including these checks and balances into your system. That’s ok! Leadership will either accept the lengthier process after you show them your commitment to quality. Or they’ll still want it fast, but they’ll see a need for more people on your team. Hopefully. :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if you want to chat more!!",
