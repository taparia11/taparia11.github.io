For example, I client I work with doesn't have any nice funnels set up but will tell you the time they booked a $20k job from their web form. From there, what % of web form inquiries convert (guesstimate if you have you) * average sale amount = value of one lead. Work from there to estimate what % of organic traffic could convert to a lead.",

If the property that's the target of any SEO can demonstrate that it makes money (either directly on indirectly), then there's a math-path to gauging out a potential investment. For example, I client I work with doesn't have any nice funnels set up but will tell you the time they booked a $20k job from their web form. From there, what % of web form inquiries convert (guesstimate if you have you) * average sale amount = value of one lead. Work from there to estimate what % of organic traffic could convert to a lead."
