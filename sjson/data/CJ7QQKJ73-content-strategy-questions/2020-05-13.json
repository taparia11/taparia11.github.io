But as you say, developers have no time to write, so I write for them (I'm a former technical writer so I at least understand the content). My question is, *would you change any of this if you're trying to market a service rather than a product?* I work for a VC that is also kind of like an agency (lends out developers). We want to A) Attract new talent and B) Get startups to use our dev expertise. I try to write about developer learnings in the field, but the topics are a bit scatter-gun right now....",

The biggest barrier I've run into is the awarding body having a pretty strict media kit full of things we either can't say or have to very specifically say. But if that isn't a factor, I like to dive into what the award stands for and the methodology for how we were awarded. For instance, we were awarded  for a a seasonal hiring program, so I just broke down the criteria for winning the award (increased brand awareness, increased quality conversions, etc.) and wrote a blog highlighted the tools, even customer quotes, that painted a picture of how we can help people build seasonal hiring programs. Those pieces are always so positive and fun to write. :slightly_smiling_face:",

The biggest barrier I've run into is the awarding body having a pretty strict media kit full of things we either can't say or have to very specifically say. But if that isn't a factor, I like to dive into what the award stands for and the methodology for how we were awarded. For instance, we were awarded  for a a seasonal hiring program, so I just broke down the criteria for winning the award (increased brand awareness, increased quality conversions, etc.) and wrote a blog highlighted the tools, even customer quotes, that painted a picture of how we can help people build seasonal hiring programs.
