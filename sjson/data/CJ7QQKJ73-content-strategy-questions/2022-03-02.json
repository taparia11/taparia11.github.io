I run a podcast for Shopify called <https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/01nOz8LFIoZcM34XDPEEgW|In Conversation with Shopify Plus>, where we speak with big-name founder\/CEO business types.\n\n*I'm curious how marketers here that may be involved in branded company podcasts measure ROI.* That is to say, \"When factoring in costs including production and any paid ad promotion, what is a reasonable cost\/listen number to spit out at the end?\"\n\nI've Googled my brains out on this, only to come up with every permutation of answer under the sun, so I thought a little crowd-sourcing here would be valuable.\n\nDoes anyone use a target cost\/listen metric? What might you consider \"good\" vs. \"bad\" in the cost to acquire listeners? Any numbers to share in your own experience? Many thanks in advance :slightly_smiling_face:",

I haven’t been able to figure that out, so it seems like you have to manually enter due dates for all subtasks each time.  Would love to know if you’ve found a workaround!"
