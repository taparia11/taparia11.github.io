Some of this stuff may be included as subpoints within the points you mentioned, but when it comes to blogs, specifically, here are some other items we think about when planning and drafting blogs:\n• How do blogs fit into larger marketing campaigns? \n• To that end, where do these blogs fit into the funnel? Most of the time, it's awareness-level, but sometimes they can go into that MOFU phase. \n• Where\/how will we promote the blogs (just posting on website? Social shares? Including it as a link in another asset? Sending along in sales email cadences?\n• What's the ultimate objective of the blog? What's the big CTA?\n• Is there opportunity to refresh an older blog that was high-performing?\nI have some thoughts about larger content marketing strat, specifically how content strat tends to be big developers and advocates of brand, but this is blog-specific.
