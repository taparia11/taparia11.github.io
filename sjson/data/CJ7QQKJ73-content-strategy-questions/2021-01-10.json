It’s not my favourite thing to jump around from platform to platform, but it’s currently the most affordable way to do things.\n\nOther than that, I schedule time to:\n• Draft and schedule posts \n• Spend 30 minutes 1-2x\/week to search for user-generated content. This includes reaching out to the original poster to connect and request permission to use their photo \n• Block 30 mins.- 1 hour in the morning and evening to respond to comments\/ DMs\/ engage with other posts in the same space. \nI think one of the most valuable uses of my time (for the purposes of my work) asides from scheduling posts is finding UGC. It makes followers of the brand feel seen\/heard, and it provides wonderful content to use in the organic and paid feed.\n\nHappy to discuss more if you’d like. Just shoot me a DM :slightly_smiling_face:",
