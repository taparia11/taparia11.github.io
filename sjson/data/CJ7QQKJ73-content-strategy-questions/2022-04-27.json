Structural updates for skimmability (headers, bullet points, etc?) Adding internal links (and if so, what are your highest-priority pages?) New stats? New customer quotes from existing case studies? More CTAs? Target keywords added\/updated? So basically, agree with everyone else here that a simple checklist would go a long way, along with an example of an existing page that you love so I can understand what you’re looking for.",

General improvements to writing quality? Structural updates for skimmability (headers, bullet points, etc?) Adding internal links (and if so, what are your highest-priority pages?) New stats? New customer quotes from existing case studies? More CTAs? Target keywords added\/updated? So basically, agree with everyone else here that a simple checklist would go a long way, along with an example of an existing page that you love so I can understand what you’re looking for."
