I feel that with some tight planning (and support from those who know what they're doing) it would be possible to write, publish and promote an entire book in one quarter.\n\nJust depends on your goals.\n\nI once drafted a book in 30 days. I wrote 30,000 words during that time. I worked with a book writing coach at the time.\n\nI didn't end up publishing that book as\n1) I didn't feel the quality was what it needed to be,\n2) I was overwhelmed by the process and price of publishing the book,\n3) My focus and business changed, so the timing wasn't working for me, and\n4) Imposter syndrome kicked in.\n\nI'm currently embarking on writing a new book on leveraging case studies for B2B growth. I've written the outline, and as part of the research for the book, I'll be interviewing companies that are using case studies to market and sell their services.\n\nJust lined up an interview with Hubspot and started reaching out to various companies for interviews.\n\nAnyways, keep us posted on your progress.
