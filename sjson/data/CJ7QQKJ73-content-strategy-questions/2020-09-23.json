Usually with those types of changes, we don’t run A\/B tests to validate our subjective ideas on what’s a better experience for subscribing\/downloading, etc. because they aren’t that “mission-critical” in most cases (though all design decisions are definitely backed up by best practices\/logic). That being said, the general question of what you can do to drive more engagement with content is a really interesting conversation – interested to hear what others have to say.\n\nThe main one that comes to mind because it always has the biggest impact is the overall branding\/design of the site – the results of it not only being done really well but also suitable to the people we have in mind somehow never fails to impress us. More comments, more shares, more links, more sign-ups, more conversions. More of everything good basically :)",

Usually with those types of changes, we don’t run A\/B tests to validate our subjective ideas on what’s a better experience for subscribing\/downloading, etc. because they aren’t that “mission-critical” in most cases (though all design decisions are definitely backed up by best practices\/logic). That being said, the general question of what you can do to drive more engagement with content is a really interesting conversation – interested to hear what others have to say.\n\nThe main one that comes to mind because it always has the biggest impact is the overall branding\/design of the site – the results of it not only being done really well but also suitable to the people we have in mind somehow never fails to impress us. More comments, more shares, more links, more sign-ups, more conversions. More of everything good basically :)"
