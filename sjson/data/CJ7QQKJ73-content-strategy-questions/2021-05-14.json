The thing that's no fun about SEO is that in competitive spaces a lot of the SERPs conform, so you're boxed into a narrower content format.\n\nSubstack and personal blogs are interesting because they're much more free form and can be what the creator wants them to be. Distribution channel is important, but I don't think it affects the shape of the content in the same way.",

The thing that's no fun about SEO is that in competitive spaces a lot of the SERPs conform, so you're boxed into a narrower content format.\n\nSubstack and personal blogs are interesting because they're much more free form and can be what the creator wants them to be. Distribution channel is important, but I don't think it affects the shape of the content in the same way."
