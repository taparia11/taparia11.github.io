Take a voice recorder (ideally not your phone) with you on a walk and just ramble away. ~20 mins is equivalent to about 1000 words. Then run it through Dragon or another transcription app. You'll end up rewriting most of it — but at least you won't have to face the terror of the blank screen."

Just dropping thoughts in a chat box. (So meta.)\n• Frame it like a presentation. Imagine you're submitting a talk to a conference. What's the POV? What's the key argument? What are the takeaways\/\"learnings\"?\n• Riffing on the above: Do a slide deck first. Knock out the visual concepts and important points. Flesh it out from there. I've monologued to myself while out on walks or running errands.\n• Listicles. Seriously. \"The X things I believe about Y.\" Change the title afterwards, but it forces you to come up with the key points.",
