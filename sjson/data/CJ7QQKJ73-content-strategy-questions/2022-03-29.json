In other words - I try to understand what prospects are looking for during the evaluation phase.\n\nI've also built out messaging frameworks (similar to battle cards) but it's more of an \"a la cart\" or swipe file approach. This way after an SDR or AE has a discovery call  - they can tailor a follow-up email with the best data points and content to help the prospect make the best decision."
