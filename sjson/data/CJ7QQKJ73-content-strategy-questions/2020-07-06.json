A\/B testing content headlines to see which performs better; Depending on the tool, you could technically customize more within it (intro paragraphs, images, etc.) to see what performs--but I’ve never gone beyond headlines.\n2. Testing concepts through paid ads and seeing clickthrough rates could also indicate “hey, this is a topic\/offer my core audience is interested in\/understands.” As an example, we’ve found some topics\/terms in ads perform better than others--so we focus on using that for our content strategy since it’s resonating.\n3. If possible, use a customer community to test content and collect feedback. (Hop on calls, do a poll\/form after they read it, etc.) Partner communities\/contacts could also be good for this. \n4. Re: is it readable\/understandable--set up a poll at the end and just ask :slightly_smiling_face: Could use free forms, a paid polling tool like Qualtrics, a social polling mechanism (LI and Twitter have them).\n\nHope some of this is helpful brainstorming. Good luck with the article.",
