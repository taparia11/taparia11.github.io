SIP trunking is the natural step up from traditional style ISDN services. If you are not ready to make the full leap to hosted voice, or can still leverage services on your existing PBX, SIP is the ideal middle ground. For businesses that rely on their phone system, ensuring connectivity and communications are reliable, futureproof and at the best market rate is imperative. The ISDN market quickly became a race to the bottom in price. However, it remains more expensive than SIP and doesn’t satisfy the reliability or futureproofing requirements.",

This is particularly great for someone to easily see \"whats new\" since they left or last checked in on the product.\n\nMy issue is where to put this content. Here's an example of a <https:\/\/paperbell.activehosted.com\/social\/f2217062e9a397a1dca429e7d70bc6ca.149|recent one about adding phone numbers>.\n\n<https:\/\/Paperbell.com\/blog\/|And here's our blog>, which is biz advice for coaches (our target market). The product updates feel really out of place in the blog, but maybe I just need to create a separate section for them somehow?\n\nI was also thinking they could live on our <https:\/\/paperbell.com\/support\/|support site> in some way, maybe just a \"latest updates\" section of articles where they're piped in? But that could get confusing when you search for a topic and find the email about it instead of the in-depth help doc you're looking for.\n\nWhat would you do? Where should I stick this content?\n\nThanks!",
