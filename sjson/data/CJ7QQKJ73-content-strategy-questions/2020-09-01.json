Are they so busy that they no longer have time to send you an email? Is the norm now not to respond if the answer is \"no?\" Have they stolen my ideas (despite me reminding them of my ownership) so know they don't need me?

Are they so busy that they no longer have time to send you an email? Is the norm now not to respond if the answer is \"no?\" Have they stolen my ideas (despite me reminding them of my ownership) so know they don't need me?
