If it's under 100 it starts to get iffy IMO, even with transparency. The third-party provider should have been open though about their ability to get to a specific number of qualified responses. B2B niche audiences can be challenging, but IMO the best panel companies are very upfront about whether the can guarantee it or not. And, your soft launch (first 10%) should also give you an opportunity to see how your audience qualifiers are impacting responses. Anyway, I could go on and on about this since it's a specialty and passion of mine, but I won't. But feel free to reach out if you want any more post-mortem advice on how to avoid this scenario for the future.",
