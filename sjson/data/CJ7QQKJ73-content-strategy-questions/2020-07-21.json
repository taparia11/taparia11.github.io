That will make it easy for them to respond and easy for readers to understand. If you want to introduce some variety you can give different experts different questions.\n\nIf you're pitching to people, you should have a contact list that is at least twice as large as the number of people you will actually publish, because not everybody will respond to you, and not all of those who do respond will have useful responses.\n\nKeep in mind that those experts are under NO OBLIGATION to answer your questions. unless you're writing for Forbes they will have no idea who you are and experts may not consider your site\/pitch worth responding to. Don't take it personally.\n\nThey get pitched 100x a day and yours is just one more in the pile. Show some effort and make your query memorable and unique. Personalize each query to show you value them as individuals"

The idea is that clients who want a little of this and a little that hire me to augment their staff with a content expert for 5 days. I'm going to add 30 days of post-engagement Slack support, but need to provide guardrails. That won't include, for instances, me editing a blogpost via Slack.\n\nHave any of you. ever tried anything like this with follow-up support? Do you have any suggestions re; rules or guidelines for the Slack support? (I don't think this is appropriate, but I could—for example—say they can only ask me yes-or-no questions.) I imagine they'll ask me to refresh their memory about a rule, ask if they're using a framework I've introduced correctly, that sort of thing. But I have to impose limits. Would love ideas if you have them or advice if you've tried this.",

The idea is that clients who want a little of this and a little that hire me to augment their staff with a content expert for 5 days. I'm going to add 30 days of post-engagement Slack support, but need to provide guardrails. That won't include, for instances, me editing a blogpost via Slack.\n\nHave any of you. ever tried anything like this with follow-up support? Do you have any suggestions re; rules or guidelines for the Slack support? (I don't think this is appropriate, but I could—for example—say they can only ask me yes-or-no questions.) I imagine they'll ask me to refresh their memory about a rule, ask if they're using a framework I've introduced correctly, that sort of thing. But I have to impose limits. Would love ideas if you have them or advice if you've tried this."
