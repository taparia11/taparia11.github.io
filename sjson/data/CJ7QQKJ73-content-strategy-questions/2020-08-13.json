It was pretty successful by most measures but it took a lot of work to get there and it was something our audience was really craving.\n• We would get about 30-60 people live and then many views (1000s) after the fact. \n• We paired the live stream with reminder emails, show summaries, and downloads from the experts featured on the show. \n• We took the recorded streams and chopped them up into bite size snippets for social promotion, that we circulated on social and to our experts\/influencers that made them want to share. \n• We targetted guests who were charasmatic and had big followings, hoping they would drive viewers, which was relatively rare\n• We would have the same 10-20 people on every stream, and people were genuinely upset when we decided to take a break\n• Our sales team said that it really helped with prospecting because people had actually already seen the show or heard of it, and if they hadn’t and they suggested it they said it made our brand look really high-quality and cool\n• We actively encouraged people to chat and ask questions which was great for engagement\n• We heavily branded and structured the show, which people really responded to\n• We transcribed all the episodes and hosted them and the recordings on a gated page to get leads\n• We also used blog posts with insights from various shows to promote it as well\n• The main issues we had were with bandwidth (they were a load of work) and Linkedin just being a crappy channel because you couldn’t RSVP to them and you only were notified of the Livestream if you were already online, and sometimes it was glitchy and hard to find",
