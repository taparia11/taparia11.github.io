She had some of the most groundbreaking ideas that I've ever seen. Since then, I've seen her move mountains for companies of all shapes and sizes. I cannot emphasize, enough, how talented she is. She also teaches for UC Berkeley Extension and is an active mentor.\n\nI was very proud to learn that she is venturing into entrepreneurship for the second time. She is looking for freelance opportunities to design and execute studies, run workshops, offer training, conduct audits, etc. She's also open to part time and consulting work.\n\nIf anyone happens to know of opportunities please let me know how she can best contact you.",
