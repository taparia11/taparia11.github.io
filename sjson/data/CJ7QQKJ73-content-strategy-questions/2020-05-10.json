Everyone is expected to be experts in their specific field.\n\nMy team does interface with external agencies and we all critique the creative, but that's in the capacity of making sure the explainer videos are understandable by the audience.\n\nWe don't touch our social media campaigns or other general marketing activities directly. We do however collaborate with the divisions and gather information.\n\nWhen I was at Airbnb, we had a very similar model. I occasionally helped other teams but it required approval from my manager and the department head.\n\nSo overall, I've found that in large orgs, the model is typically you're expected to be an expert in your area, and you need to trust your colleagues to be experts in their roles.",

Oftentimes, that bleeds into them knowing a lot about digital and having comments about copy and content (things like, 'that's a strange word to use, because the target audience doesn't necessarily speak like that'), but I wouldn't say our marketing team expects them to know content marketing basics or how campaigns work, etc. Hope you can find something that works for your team!
