        "text": "Hey everyone,\nwhen it comes to your team members' goals and responsibilities, would you say the same person (eg: content specialist or content editor) is responsible for guaranteeing content quality &amp; ranking #1 for a given keyword? I mean, knowing that ranking #1 is a multi-skilled effort (that included not only the relevance of the content, but also page rank, backlinks, ux, etc), does it make sense do hold someone accountable for ranking #1 for that keyword?\n\nI'm asking that because I'm not quite sure if the same person who edits our content should also be responsible for going after backlinks, cross promotion, for example.",

Would it help us scale things (like post updates) more quickly? Yes.\n\nBut is it also beneficial for me (as a writer) to be in the weeds of keyword research, rankings, social sharing, etc., as an analyst? Definitely.",
