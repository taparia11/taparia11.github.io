Plus, we want to show the folks \"behind the scenes\" in writing and editorial because that work isn't always as visible.\n\nI'm a _huge_ fan, always, of commissioning or gathering (and can be super scrappy, with Typeform, for example, or even a LinkedIn poll) proprietary data and the survey process to get real insights from target communities and audiences to back up our hypotheses and ideas. I think we'll also dive into more interactive content (dynamic microsites and quizzes) as well.",
