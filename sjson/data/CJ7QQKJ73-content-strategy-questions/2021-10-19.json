I completely agree with your approach but the problem for me is all the problems and related searches identified to my particular buyer are low search volume.\n\nFor example, I would like to attract product managers who oversee SaaS product integrations. Any search related to their particular role is low volume.\n\nAs product managers, they have pain points that are broader and I could write content that attracts \"b2b SaaS product managers\" but 99% of that audience would be irrelevant to me (as 99% SaaS product managers are not handling product integrations) and it would be very competitive to get traffic there because there is a ton of quality content for PMs already.\n\nSo I have \"integration user stories\" which brings in like 40-50 clicks a month from search but is probably 90% the right person and it is not that competitive because not that many people are writing on it.\n\nBut I could certainly try to experiment more with higher volume, less targeted searches and see if I am able to get enough clicks to attract some of the relevant audience.\n\nThank you!",
