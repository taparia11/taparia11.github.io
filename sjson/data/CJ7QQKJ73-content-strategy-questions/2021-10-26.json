Create the page for \"best business credit cards for startups\". Create it in the way the audience expects it. Listicles in the SERP? Do a listicle, but better. Optimize it well. \n2. Create a cluster of relevant articles on the subject. Interlink everything in the cluster. \n3. Get backlinks for the \"pillar\" on the exact anchor \"best business credit cards for startups\". \n4. Get backlinks for the other articles in the cluster as well.\n5. Soon, you'll see your whole cluster grow like this: <https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/RtnaQAQ.png> Yaay, you've got topical authority now. \nThe method is tried and tested. I managed to rank a client's landing page higher than the behemoths that were dominating the SERP (DR 88, 89, 91) while my client has DR 76 (DA 41).
