But organic is a much more blue chip (if boring) strategy, and communities like DEV, where you can build a following, are much less all-or-nothing for establishing a founder as an influencer.  I'd think of it as an investment portfolio: organic is blue chip, community sites are overseas funds, and aggregators like HN\/reddit are IPOs\/venture capital.  19 out of 20 do absolutely nothing and 1 rocket ships."
