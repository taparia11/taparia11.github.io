If we tried ungating, our main source of email capture would become demo requests and probably webinars since it's harder to ungate reg for those.

This is mainly because our paid team uses content a lot to gather leads, so they’re hungry for more gated stuff! Then after a while once it’s kinda exhausted and we have something new for them, so we open it up.\n\nAnd actually, if it’s like a big guide, we are putting it into a LP and letting it start to rank organically for a while before we lift the gates. So, some folks may stumble on that page in the first few months by chance without having to ever put in an email :nerd_face:\n\nNot sure if this is the best tactic, but so far it’s been working for us.\n\nAnother thing we’ve tried a bit is having something gated, but creating an un-gated “lite” version. So people can still get value from it, and if they want more, they can fill in the form.",
