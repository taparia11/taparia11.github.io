And if you want to be effective at the executive layer you need to compress and package your ideas well. There’s three things to focus on, you need to be *concise, credible &amp; compelling.\"*\n\n\n<https:\/\/seomba.substack.com\/p\/presenting-to-the-ceo-in-5-slides>",

We had a very broad, general idea of the final outcome.\n\nIt was \"create a series featuring professionals in [THIS] industry\"\n\nSo, I created a strategy document listing the goals, target audience of the final article, target job positions of the reader, interview topic ideas, potential questions, and outcomes.\n\nI came up with a list of questions that were both personal to the individual and also relevant to the industry and indirectly related to the SaaS product the 'series' company offers.\n\nThen for the interview itself, I emailed him ahead of time with a brief generalized overview of what I would ask about. In the interview, I started with simple intro questions, then asked job and industry-related questions. I then just followed his lead on some answers he gave.\n\nOnce I got some info from those answers, I would guide it back to my other potential questions. In about 30 minutes, we got through about 10-12 questions.\n\nI recorded the interview, transcribed it, then did lots of editing to create relevant headers as questions.\n\nAdditionally, I researched multiple relevant industry-related statistics to help add some 'meat' to the article. Then, I added screenshots of the data and statistics.\n\nI created a Table of Contents and also added a Summary of bullet points at the beginning of the article.\n\nAt the end, I added a list of all the Links in the article (like a citations list, but just the titles and links)\n\nExcluding the Table of Contents and the Link titles at the end, the final article was 2,008 words.\n\nAnd now, I'm going to write a blog post about all this. haha.",

In the interview, I started with simple intro questions, then asked job and industry-related questions. I then just followed his lead on some answers he gave.\n\nOnce I got some info from those answers, I would guide it back to my other potential questions. In about 30 minutes, we got through about 10-12 questions.\n\nI recorded the interview, transcribed it, then did lots of editing to create relevant headers as questions.\n\nAdditionally, I researched multiple relevant industry-related statistics to help add some 'meat' to the article. Then, I added screenshots of the data and statistics.\n\nI created a Table of Contents and also added a Summary of bullet points at the beginning of the article.\n\nAt the end, I added a list of all the Links in the article (like a citations list, but just the titles and links)\n\nExcluding the Table of Contents and the Link titles at the end, the final article was 2,008 words.\n\nAnd now, I'm going to write a blog post about all this. haha."
