We’re having a problem with industry segmentation in our creation of pillar posts \/ content clusters. \n\nFinding that many independent professionals or small businesses  (eg plumbers, insurance agents, etc) don’t see themselves under a general category - particularly when searching - and expect tailored content for their industry when researching tools \/ content. Many of the terms we’d want to rank for would include the industry segment since our audience includes it in their organic search - ex: ‘best referral software for plumbers’ vs anything close to ‘small business referral software’ where there’s also a lot more competition.\n\nThe problem is that there is 95% carryover between industries so creating multiple versions for each pillar would likely be duplicative content without rewriting each time to say the same thing.\n\nHas anyone created industry segment pillar posts as part of a hub and spoke model, and if so - how have you gotten over the fact that the prospects aren’t always facing as unique of challenges as they believe they do?",
