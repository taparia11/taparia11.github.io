That’s something we’ve found works especially when you want to capture demand from specific searches and get them to a particular article but then want to cater to people who would rather consume content in one long-form piece.\n\nTag the articles, compile them into an ebook they can download and add it as an opt-in to each spoke page.\n\nWe’ve usually compile all the content into one long-form page that we `noindex` but promote on the spoke pages as an ultimate guide (this avoids the issues you run into where ultimate guides don’t match the broad search intent and would otherwise cause the pages to compete with one another).\n\nWe lean toward this approach vs ebook because we care more about content consumption than lead gen. \n\n*It depends on the behavior of your specific audience though.* \n\nWe just found that the ebook route resulted in a few things: \n\n1. Plenty of leads that never converted (&lt;0.3%), which just meant wasted time and money spent on building marketing automation sequences and BDR\/SDR cadences.\n2. Lack of consumption. We surveyed people and learned many downloaded the ebooks who never read them…which wasn't surprising when we stepped back and thought about our underlying assumptions about how to market and sell.\n    a. I remember creating a tag on my Mac to tag all the ebooks for that one day in the future when I would read them. :man-facepalming:\nWhen we compared the performance data from the long-form content with the gated content route, they were better. \n\nWe also gained the added benefit of getting consumption data in the form of time on page, activity (scroll depth, mouse tracking, next page, exit page, etc.).\n\n\nWhich is really useful on the marketing automation\/sales cadence side of things—especially when you know who the visitor is from some prior opt-in and such.\n\n\nThe idea being if we’re going to have BDRs spend time trying nurture relationships, they might as well focus on the people that are actually consuming the content and showing other high-intent behaviors (e.g. spent x min on page + scrolled y % + visited an additional high intent page—pricing, demo, etc.).\n\n&gt; *But to be clear*, I still think ebooks can be useful and have their place.
