I was in a similar role at my former job and has the same challenges.\n\nCollecting leads via gated content will certainly become a lot more challenging but I don’t think it’s going to disappear. People take a long time to change their habits.\n\nI see things evolving towards a very focused approach, where quality (in both content, approach, and leads) overpowers volume but I know this is an idealistic view.\n\nHave you considered writing about this? I think the topic would inspire an important conversation that many content marketers would like to have.",
