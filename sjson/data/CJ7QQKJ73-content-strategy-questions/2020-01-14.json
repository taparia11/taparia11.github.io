(For context, we are an B2B SaaS Company serving enterprise clients.)\n\nWe’ve been running exceptionally successful education-focused webinars (KPIs: registrants, attendees, emails). Now we want to apply those skills to our product webinars and see if we can bump up our KPIs around demos and SQLs.\n\nWe’ve always been uncomfortable developing this kind of content and have consistently erred on the side of education vs. selling the product because we so badly do not want to alienate our audience.\n\n(Also for context, our avg. buyer only stays in their job for 2 years before they move onto the next company so if they can’t get us approved in their current org. we do get a second chance later if we can keep them interested.)\n\nSo three questions:\n\n1. Who is doing this well? I would love to see examples of demoey\/producty webinars that do a good job. \n2. What are your experiences with standing, group demo type webinars? Have you seen success? Do they lead to personalized webinars? \n3. Do you have any advice (besides know your audience + provide value) for creating product content that people actually want to watch\/read?\nThank you!",
