What we is assigning them pieces with a detailed briefing of what they should be writing about giving a specific subject. Depending on the piece, we'll even give them the sections and sub-sections they should be writing about. In our case (excepting really inspiring pieces), we realised that the more context we give them, the beteer will be the piece they write. Not sure if that it's what you're looking for, but I'd be glad to help :slightly_smiling_face:",

I'm working with a group of very opinionated data analysts so for the moment my process is 1. give them keywords 2. work with them to come up with angles based on their chose keyword\/topic 3. once they have an angle their excited about, give them some direction on keywords\/structure. But it might be too open-ended, we'll see. I'm still super early stages on this :slightly_smiling_face:",
