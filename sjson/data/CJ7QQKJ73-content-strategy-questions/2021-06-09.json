In the past, I haven’t even had time to think about it, but lately I’ve been reconsidering my position.\n\nTypically, they come from people who aren’t in our industry or aren’t even tangentially related. But when someone says they want to write something for free for us with consideration for some keywords we want to rank for, I’m like hmmm.. what’s the catch?\n\nSo friends who accept or reject these guest post requests: what _is_ the catch? Am I missing huge opportunities by not seriously considering these kinds of posts? Or am I rightly avoiding headaches and low quality content messes?",
