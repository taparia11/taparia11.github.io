There is tons of value in this thread already - I use most of the same principles and methods. \nI’d like to share system planner that incorporates productivity principles including Pomodoro. I use it on a daily basis and it does wonders. \n\n<https:\/\/www.intelligentchange.com\/products\/the-productivity-planner|https:\/\/www.intelligentchange.com\/products\/the-productivity-planner>\n\nThey also have a 5 minute Journal that helped me with my internal motivation, anxiety and depression. \n\nTo further boost my productivity I use <http:\/\/Brain.fm|Brain.fm>, daily meditations, exercise about 20mins a day, 8h of sleep - bed by 9:30pm and time tracking (using Toggle).\n\nI work 25 hours a week and I get a ton done like managing retainers, business development, admin tasks and learning. In the rest of my time I spend time with the family. Before I was doing emails late at night and always worrying about the business. \n\nHappy to chat with you some more if you need more info. ",
