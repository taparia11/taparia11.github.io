Ppl liked the virtual format and quite a few ppl tuned in for the full 11 hours which surprised me. \n\nAs others have said, speaker coordination &amp; logistics were definitely the main challenges. Just getting everyone familiar with the platform, ready to go at the right time, and troubleshooting various issues with the platform we used (Crowdcast).
