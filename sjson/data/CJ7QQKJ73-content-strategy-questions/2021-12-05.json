I'm not sure what specifically would make a bank ideal for a freelancer but it sounds like a space that hasn't had much attention, so interesting to hear more about it!\nI'm not sure about freelancers in other industries, but for myself in content, I'd look at groups like Rachel's List, The Freelance Jungle, Kate Toon's groups (I think there's a few including the Clever Copywriting School)... I wonder if you could connect with coworking spaces too? Perhaps there is some potential there",
