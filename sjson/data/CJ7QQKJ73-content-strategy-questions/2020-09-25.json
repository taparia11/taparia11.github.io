However, I've also been in positions where I've hired someone who wasn't producing on deadlines and it became clear fairly early on that he simply didn't yet have the skills and tools to work in a non-traditional office environment. So, part of my job as his supervisor was to coach him. It started with a 10-minute morning one-on-one standup where we would talk about the work he did the day before, review his goals for the day, and talk about how he planned to meet those objectives. I also helped him do things like find a plug-in for his browser that timed out sites during the workday that might distract him. He did most of the talking and set his limits and pretty much spent four months learning how to work from home. (I didn't tackle all of his issues at once, so as not to overwhelm him. We did a slow rollout.) He worked for me for three years after that, so it was worth the time and resources I invested in him as an employee. And, it taught me that working remotely really is a skill and it can be developed. I should mention that after four months of daily 10 minute standups, he didn't need intense coaching any longer and we moved them to just three times a week and then eventually to a weekly, 30-minute supervisor\/supervisee check in.",
