Our focus is on getting content and advertising in front of dedicated target audiences, typically across a buying committee, on a defined CPL (syndication) or CPM (advertising) basis\n\nSome things I’d look out for as you’re researching:\n\n1) Reach potential - everyone can absolutely, positively deliver leads or get in front of your audience... until they can’t. Ideal state is reach through sites where buyers are spending their time, particularly in today’s “research across multiple sites\/vendors” world. Better to get an idea of this pre-sale.\n\n2) Ability to engage a full buying committee - may not be relevant if you have a single contact\/single buyer scenario, but if you’re typical sale includes other roles (finance, legal, IT, other functions) then it’s worth digging into. Some folks specialize in particular functions, others have greater breadth to influence the full team making decisions.\n\n3) Ability to orchestrate across multiple channels - again, want to call out my bias here but I think it’s important to try and run full-funnel syndication\/ABM advertising programs if you’re responsible for more than just lead generation. If pipeline\/revenue volume or velocity are part of your team’s purview then it can help to get more exposure to your message before or after lead handoff. Sales conversion rates generally go up, particularly if the vendor is able to deliver dynamic ads or offers as the sales cycle progresses (e.g. different message and content upon opening a sales opportunity or starting a free trial, etc)\n\nThere’s more to consider when it comes to this - particularly around using sources like intent data to refine your ideal customer profile to maximize media spend - but those are three foundational questions I’d consider asking in your search",
