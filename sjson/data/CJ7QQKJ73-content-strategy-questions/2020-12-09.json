Newspapers pay the worst (but pay invoices quickly). Large businesses pay the best (but it's hit or miss how quickly they will pay your invoice). Again, this is just my experience. And 2020 has been all over the map."

Would pick a couple \"tent pole\" resources, perhaps like the one <@U014ZN613LM> recommended above (which I just ordered myself). _*<https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Brand-Against-Machine-Marketing-Competition-ebook\/dp\/B005ZRXBZ4\/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=|Brand Against the Machine>*_ is another I can recommend personally.\n\nAnd even though Sinek gets a lot of flak, I think <@U012UL77GUT> is 100% correct in invoking the Golden Circle here. The \"brand\" should have a Why, How, and What.\n\nAnd as you work through your tent pole resources, then on to others on the Internet (blogs\/podcasts\/etc), you can start to \"bucket\" all the different facets folks employ in branding into the Golden Circle:\n\nWhy = Brand purpose, stories...\nHow = Pillars, mission statements...\nWhat = Reasons to believe, brand Benefits...\n\nThis allows you to build a brand \"house\" from a solid foundation, up.\n\nThere is no one way to do this. But it helps to set yourself a bar to clear, that being: _\"Are we capturing something here that codifies this particular business in a way that is directionally\/strategically useful?\"_\n\nThat last bit's particularly important in my opinion because if you've crafted a brand that doesn't help guide the business and its marketing\/content you've got little more than a piece of paper or .ppt that someone paid a lot of money for. Which seems to happen a lot. That's why...\n\n*2.* _*<https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Knowing-Doing-Gap-Companies-Knowledge-Action\/dp\/1578511240|The Knowing\/Doing Gap>*_ is an invaluable read. Folks have brands they don't use. Others pay for brands they don't go on to use or HAVE brands that we (as marketers\/creators) have NO IDEA how to use. Can't always fix situations like this. But helpful to understand why they happen. That books a good life-read, in general.\n\n*3.* Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz is certainly an amazing machine. But without his heart, he'd just be an immaculately organized hunk of cold metal.\n\nThink of a brand you're helping to build\/capture as an engine (again, big point of a brand is to drive action). How do you ensure you've got some amazing fuel at the heart of this engine.\n\nFor this, I've never found anything better\/more useful than _*<https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Archetypes-Branding-Toolkit-Creatives-Strategists\/dp\/1440308187\/ref=asc_df_1440308187\/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=312021428070&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=7294453828347883483&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9019670&amp;hvtargid=pla-564430866610&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=&amp;ref=&amp;adgrpid=60223809017&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvadid=312021428070&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=7294453828347883483&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9019670&amp;hvtargid=pla-564430866610|Archetypes in Branding: A Toolkit for Creatives and Strategists>*_. Long story short, it's a way to build the brand on the business as a Character.\n\nBut not just any Character. Through this book, you're leveraging archetypes that cultures worldwide have woven stories around for centuries. That's a bit heady for a Wed morning, yes. But the *<https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2F7Wwew8X4Y|Monomyth, Joseph Campell stuff>* makes for great fuel for branding engines.\n\nI also love the discovery process they recommend going through in the book itself. With a bit of practice, it makes the all-important WHY tangible and emotionally engaging for a client.\n\nCaptured some of how that process looks in an old work thing *<https:\/\/www.thiscouldbegood.com\/client-seven-leaf-canada-s-first-in|here>* if you're curious.\n\nThis is a lot, but so is branding. :slightly_smiling_face: Hoping some of this will be helpful to you.\n\nBest wishes.",

I’m a senior content marketing manager moving more in the direction of demand gen trying to better align inbound and sales - and looking to possibly add a business development rep to the team to help assist and optimize inbound conversion rates.\n\nI have a good idea of the pain points we have around attracting and moving top and middle of funnel leads to conversion, but I’m not sure what this role would look like.
