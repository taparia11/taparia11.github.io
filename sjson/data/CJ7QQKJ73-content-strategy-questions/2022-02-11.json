My boss is pushing for a written down strategy to specify the metrics and how we’ll know if the ads have been a success. I plan to direct the LinkedIn ads to our podcast webpages that include the YouTube version and links to Spotify and Apple Podcasts (but let me know if you think they should direct to YouTube instead!).

Here’s a quick overview..  \n\nWe start with the clients goals and make sure they know what the implications of those are down to how the posts are chosen. For example, we don’t let them say their goals are more for brand focused content then want keyword metrics on those. Your goals must align with the content and metrics. \n\nThen we choose the percentage of content we produce each month that fits those goals. Eg. 50% keyword focused, 50% brand focused content. This informs how we source the content. \n\nThen we break it down by category and percentages of the content each month that goes into each category. That helps us know exactly what we’re talking about. Note, this can change monthly, especially for seasonal brands. We plan it out by quarter in a quarterly planning session. \n\nThen we evaluate the specific posts with a decision matrix to ensure it the criteria all the way up to the main goals (you can see we really hammer those home :smile:) Here’s a screenshot of some of those criteria: <https:\/\/share.getcloudapp.com\/6quEAQOd>",

For example, we don’t let them say their goals are more for brand focused content then want keyword metrics on those. Your goals must align with the content and metrics. \n\nThen we choose the percentage of content we produce each month that fits those goals. Eg. 50% keyword focused, 50% brand focused content. This informs how we source the content. \n\nThen we break it down by category and percentages of the content each month that goes into each category. That helps us know exactly what we’re talking about. Note, this can change monthly, especially for seasonal brands. We plan it out by quarter in a quarterly planning session. \n\nThen we evaluate the specific posts with a decision matrix to ensure it the criteria all the way up to the main goals (you can see we really hammer those home "
