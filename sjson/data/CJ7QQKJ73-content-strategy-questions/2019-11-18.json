        "text": "(part 1) I've done quite a bit of this kind of work in a few different contexts. In the startup environment where it was like \"try to use every resource and get max value out of it\". Then at HubSpot when I was running their Medium publication. Then later, also for HubSpot, as we built out the communications team and started doing more executive thought leadership. Now in my current role this is important again, though much more leveraging internal expertise that is valuable to our community. So with that context, some thoughts on your questions...\n\n• How have you approached getting contributions? (I don't expect people to write it up themselves)\nHubSpot has an internal wiki, that was HUGE in helping me source contributors. I would scour the wiki, find interesting topics, and with some light editing, could often make it good for public consumption. Other places to search for topic ideas &amp; creators: internal Slack, Google Drive, team meetings. Anything that can help you get from 0 content to 60% there is a HUGE boost in getting people to deliver.\n\nLook for people in the organization who are already creating content (speaking at events, writing guests posts, even just great internal speakers). Broad calls for contributors tended to bring in a lot of people who _wanted_ to write...which is very different from people who will deliver :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nI would also recommend working with a small group of contributors (no more than 3\/content marketer). Once you create momentum with someone, and they get their first 2-3 articles in the world, things start to pick up. It's fun! But getting the first piece out the door is almost always a grind. It seems like a good idea to cast a wide net and get a bunch of pieces in the queue, but things don't really work out that way. Focus your efforts on making a few people very successful contributors.\n\nIn my current role, I'm not maintaining a very aggressive content calendar. So it's much more: \"If you see an interesting artifact that has potential, let me know.\" It's slow, but I'm 7 months into the role and momentum is starting to build. Someone even came to me the other day and said \"I did some keyword research on this topic idea I had...\" I almost fell over. Totally shocked :smile:\n\n\n• Traffic to those contributions is tricky – how did you approach search for this content?\nAt HubSpot, we didn't care too much about search for this type of content. Instead, we relied heavily on personal sharing, newsletters, and Medium's algorithm for content going on the Medium publication. Linkedin in HOT right now for this kind of content. And in general, people are more likely to share an article written by a coworker on their team than someone in marketing.\n\nI also said \"no\" a LOT at HubSpot. If I thought a post wasn't going to perform well I encouraged people to publish their ideas on LinkedIn or Medium. I tried to make it clear that saying, \"I can't prioritize this right now\" was very different than saying \"This is a bad idea that isn't worth writing about.\"\n\nIn my current role, I'm more focused on search, but the company has a lot of focus around what we do, so it isn't too hard to find alignment. For example, my co-worker recently said \"I did this writeup for a client on how to review a pull request. Maybe there's a version that's relevant to blog readers?\" So we repackaged it into a post that fits into our topic cluster on analytics engineering. Very nice fit. (Post is here if you're interested: <https:\/\/blog.getdbt.com\/how-to-review-an-analytics-pull-request\/>)",

        "text": "(part 2) • What obstacles am I probably not considering (but will definitely come up)?\n*1. Alignment with business priorities*: It isn't enough for even the CEO to say \"this is important!\" There has to be a logical connection to the work employees are being asked to do and the impact it will have on important business priorities.\n2. *Personal motivations:* Content creation requires a mental shift out of one's usual work mindset. The only way to get people to build a habit around this is if you understand what they personally want from it. It can be an event they want to speak at, a competitor that gets under their skin, a desire to teach or be seen as an expert in their space, or recruit talent to their team. It is so worthwhile doing this work to understand personal motivations. It makes it much easier to motivate them down the road (and you will absolutely have to do motivation work)\n\nFinal note, this work is hard, but it is worth it. There is no substitute for expertise and content created by internal experts has real staying power.",
