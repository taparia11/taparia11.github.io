I guess it depends on what kind of community you're talking about - whether you mean a community of fans (your audience) or an actual community, more what Jordy was talking about. I think Gong is a good example of a brand who is growing the first type of community (the audience) through all their social media and content marketing and branding efforts. But if you're talking about the second, a branded online community that you build and invite customers or prospects or industry folks to join (like Sephora's... Gain Grow Retain's... etc) then there's definitely a science and process. I think <@UJG9WTEKG> could speak to this, he's done such a nice job of building this Slack community! I'm not an expert in this but rub shoulders w\/ a lot of community builders because that's what my company does.

Content creators use the Docs template and design does a quick review at the end before they make it a PDF.\n\nAgree with <@UUH2EB134> that the best downloads build off a successful piece of content and walk people through how to implement recommendations themselves. In the pre-COVID days we’d also sometimes create resource sheets that someone might print out and put in their office (e.g. best times to post, hashtag holidays - our focus is social media) but most folks don’t have printers at home now!",
