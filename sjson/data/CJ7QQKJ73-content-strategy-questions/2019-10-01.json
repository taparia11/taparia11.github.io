        "text": "Having some relevant work to show is certainly good, but I don't think it's a must-have for an entry level role. I\"m always happy to look at writing samples from college projects when I'm hiring entry-level.\n\nMy recommendation would be to work somewhere that does really great content marketing -- great at SEO, great editorial, great process -- whatever it is, there should be something that sets them apart. If you work for the people doing that, you'll learn a ton about your craft.\n\nI would avoid, at all costs, job openings for junior people that say things like, \"You'll get to create our content strategy from scratch!\" When you're just getting started, this much freedom is not actually a good thing and you'll be working for people who don't understand how content marketing (or marketing in general) works.\n\nSpend a few years working for someone you admire early in your career, Learn everything you can from them. Get really good at your niche.",
