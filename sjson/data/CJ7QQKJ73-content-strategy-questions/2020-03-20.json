Especially if your employees are suddenly having to juggle managing their children, with all the school closures.\nWhen I teach an online course, I set \"live hours\" where I can be reached in a group setting, but I also make as much of the material available in as many different formats as possible.\nI also customize it to the needs and interests of my students. I gather this intel by asking folks to \"bring themselves to the table,\" share photos of their home, their families, talk about their interests, share something with the class that nobody else has experienced yet.\nI end up hearing a lot of really great music this way!"
