Some of this content ranks extremely well in specific niches. The problem is that these niches have nothing to do with our own business niche. This has led certain SEO tools (that shall remain nameless) to think that our main competitors are websites about the sinking of the Titanic.\n\nIs this subdomain content likely to confuse Google in the same way it has confused certain SEO tools? Is our actual content getting penalised due to the success of this user-generated subdomain content? \n\nFollow-up: Would there be SEO benefits in us stopping this stuff from being indexed? And would this be comparable to the benefits some folks see from deleting stale content from their blog?",

The problem is that these niches have nothing to do with our own business niche. This has led certain SEO tools (that shall remain nameless) to think that our main competitors are websites about the sinking of the Titanic.\n\nIs this subdomain content likely to confuse Google in the same way it has confused certain SEO tools? Is our actual content getting penalised due to the success of this user-generated subdomain content? \n\nFollow-up: Would there be SEO benefits in us stopping this stuff from being indexed? And would this be comparable to the benefits some folks see from deleting stale content from their blog?"
