From that applied experience, here's my take:\n• It's an unreliable medium for views -- most of the stuff you submit will go nowhere fast, and there really is no magic formula (else the same entities would be up there a lot)\n• If you're going to submit your own stuff, have an account where you submit a lot of stuff besides your own to avoid looking transparently self-promotional.\n• If you can get others to put your content there, that's much better.\n• Tease controversial, \"make enemies\" Moz style positions out of the CEO.   If your company makes, say, an automated testing tool, \"It's Unprofessional Not to Test in 2021\" will be much more likely to trend there than \"Reasons You Should Test.\"  Every post I ever had there that drove 10K+ views from the medium had a title like \"The Beggar CEO and Sucker Culture\" or \"Hiring is Broken and It Isn't Worth Fixing.\"\n• If you're going the non-rant style, original insights or unprecedented things do well, like \"I just rewrote the original Mario Brothers as a browser app\"\n• If it were me, I'd have a primary purpose\/plan for the content that wasn't trending on Hacker News.  IOW, you have a plan for the content and treat trending on HN as a bonus, should it happen.\n• Don't let your CEO read the comments.  :wink:",
