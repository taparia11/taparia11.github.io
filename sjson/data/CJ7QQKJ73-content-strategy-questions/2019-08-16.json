        "text": "Hey everyone,\nI just read this *Ahrefs post on Canonicals* [<https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/canonical-tags\/>] and I just wanted a 2nd opinion on one of the things they said we should avoid:\n\n&gt;Mistake #4: Canonicalizing all paginated pages to the root page\n\n&gt; Paginated pages should not be canonicalized to the first paginated page in the series. Instead, self-referencing canonicals should be used on all paginated pages.\n\n&gt; Why? As Google's John Mueller stated on Reddit, this is improper use the rel=canonical:\n&gt; _The main thing to avoid, since this post is about canonicalization, is to use the rel=canonical on page 2 pointing to page 1. Page 2 isn't equivalent to page 1, so the rel=canonical like that would be incorrect._\n&gt;- John Mueller\n----------\n1) I do have canonicals on my pagination. Should I remove those?\n2) If I have pages such as `product\/shoes\/nike\/nike-shox` and `product\/nike-shox`, should I use canonicals on any of those pages?",

        "text": "The use of canonicals on paginated content is usually for archive-type pages generated by WordPress. So, for example, you might have:\n\n\/blog\/\n\/blog\/page\/2\/\n\/blog\/page\/3\/\n...\n\/blog\/page\/432\/\n\n...and so on.\n\nFor _those_ pages, the canonical tag should be \"self-referring,\" so \/blog\/page\/432\/ should have a canonical tag that points to \/blog\/page\/432\/, _not_ \/blog\/.\n\nBased on the example you shared, you seem to be referencing something a bit different---two similar product pages.\n\nThe ideal solution would be not to have multiple product pages with the same content targeting the same keyword.\n\nHowever, if you _can't_ consolidate those pages, it does make sense to focus a search engine on the page you want to rank in search results.\n\nIf you're trying to decide between pages, I'd take a look at which one currently has more inertia (i.e. is already ranking), as well as whether one or another has significantly more links pointing to it.\n\nYou can use a canonical tag to point search engines to the primary page you want to rank, but remember that canonical tags are a suggestion, not a mandate, to search engines. They can obey or ignore them at their discretion.\n\nAn alternative---and more powerful---solution would be to set up 301 redirects from the superfluous versions of these product pages to the main ones. That would do a better job consolidating signals and remove the ambiguity that lingers with canonical tags.",
