So we field requests from other teams (including other marketing functions like growth\/demand and product marketing). But we also have our own brand initiatives.\n\nWe have three writers on the content team, and their work can sometimes be interchangeable. But for the most part, I've tried to give them ownership \/ specialities.

I lead the content team and report to our VP of Brand & Comms. That VP reports to our SVP of Marketing. The Brand & Comms team serves as an internal agency, basically. It includes my team (writers and one SEO specialist) plus people who focus on design, social media, events, and PR\/comms. So we field requests from other teams (including other marketing functions like growth\/demand and product marketing). But we also have our own brand initiatives.\n\nWe have three writers on the content team, and their work can sometimes be interchangeable. But for the most part, I've tried to give them ownership \/ specialities. So one focuses more on the core brand work (blog, podcast, larger brand campaign content); one focuses more on website\/SEO and event collateral; and one focuses more on growth content like ads and customer and partner initiatives."

        "text": "Hey <@U02UTRR1LFN>, I assume you mean for guest blogs, right?\n\nI manage the guest blogging program for a few of my clients, and so typically, it looks more or less like this:\n\n1. Judge the quality of their pitch \/ outreach email. Is their English, grammar, and spelling good? Is their pitch decent or does it sound like the other 100 sitting in your inbox? First impression is key, so if you’re already underwhelmed, just toss their message in the trash (this first step alone will weed out at least half or more of the pitches you receive)\n2. If you like their message and pitch, send them a link to your blog’s guidelines and ask them to send you past writing samples (to further judge the quality of their writing, particularly with guest posts — some will be surprisingly bad, so you can again toss those emails) *and* 3-4 relevant topic ideas that meet your guidelines. This step is crucial and will also weed out a good %, as many will send topics that manage to not meet your guidelines at all or even be relevant to your audience. From there, you will have an even smaller pile of pitches to actually sort through. \n3. Once you’ve confirmed a topic with them, the rest is pretty straight forward. Personally, I always ask the writer to send an outline first, to assure we’re aligned and on the same page, and again, to further judge the quality to be expected. If the outline is garbage, here is another final option to weeding out the bad quality submissions _before_ you even get to a first draft. Leave any comments or suggestions as needed on the outline.\n4. Once you receive a first draft, do a quick review. Does it require many edits that could have easily been solved with Grammarly? Don’t bother making any edits or reading further until they run through Grammarly or a similar tool, first, and then have them send the draft back. Normally, I leave suggested edits and ask them to revise whatever is needed. If it looks like it is going to take a lot of edits or &gt;1 hour of time to review\/edit, generally, these get tossed as it isn’t worth the resources or bandwidth, depending on the blog’s priorities and how much they really value or want guest blog content.\n5. Follow usual process for uploading to WP, scheduling, + publishing.\nI’ve had some clients who didn’t want to actively focus on a guest blog program, but, they wanted to use guest posts to somewhat maintain their blog and keep it “alive” while they focused on other things and invested less in content themselves…\n\nIn these instances, would adjust the steps above a tad, and assign topics ourselves to the guest writers, and also provide the outline in these instances ourselves, as most of the time, we wanted to optimize it well for seo so that the content could bring in some traffic, and not just be another guest blog sitting on the website. Whenever the guest blog program was used for this purpose, it also further cut back on the successful pitches\/submissions, as you’ll find less guest bloggers willing to go through the “hoops”, so to speak, but those who will, generally provide great content.\n\nThe main thing to look for, in my opinion, is if the writer follows the most basic instructions. If they don’t even bother to pitch topics that are relevant to your blog + audience, or that match your guidelines, then that’s enough of a red flag not to move forward. You especially want to try and weed out the ones who are just looking to submit posts that look like a link farm, and really have no interest in providing valuable\/quality content.\n\nI think that’s it in a nutshell, happy to help in any other way if there’s any follow up questions to this, or share examples of guest blog guidelines, etc :slightly_smiling_face:",

Whenever the guest blog program was used for this purpose, it also further cut back on the successful pitches\/submissions, as you’ll find less guest bloggers willing to go through the “hoops”, so to speak, but those who will, generally provide great content.\n\nThe main thing to look for, in my opinion, is if the writer follows the most basic instructions. If they don’t even bother to pitch topics that are relevant to your blog + audience, or that match your guidelines, then that’s enough of a red flag not to move forward. You especially want to try and weed out the ones who are just looking to submit posts that look like a link farm, and really have no interest in providing valuable\/quality content.\n\nI think that’s it in a nutshell, happy to help in any other way if there’s any follow up questions to this, or share examples of guest blog guidelines, etc "
