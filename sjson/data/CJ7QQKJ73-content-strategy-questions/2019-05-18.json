Do they see it as the equivalent of advertising? Do they understand that it's a long-term play? What _type_ of content are they really looking for?\n\n(This is the sort of questioning I ask internal teams when they come to us looking for help... figure it's the equivalent of getting hired, just internally versus coming into the org.)",
