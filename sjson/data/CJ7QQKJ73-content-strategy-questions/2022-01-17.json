It's unlikely that investing in content right now will net you hundreds of thousands of sign ups within three months \n\nHowever, I will note that Fintech is an _incredibly_ competitive niche, so I would recommend that you invest in growing E-A-T and content now, but supplement that with additional marketing efforts to build your base.

My analytics brain can't NOT look at past performance, but i'm not sure how I should start with this. Any advice is welcome!"
