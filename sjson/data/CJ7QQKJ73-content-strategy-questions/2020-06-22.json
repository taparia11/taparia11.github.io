Theres a school of thought that “index bloat” can act as a drag on your rankings. I’ve been in roles where we deleted the bottom 20% performing content and it lifted the performance of the other 80%.\n\n2 - If they wont budge, spin it so every announcement gets blog treatment. For example, rather than just announcing there is a new feature, write the definitive blog post on how use the feature to do X Y Z.
