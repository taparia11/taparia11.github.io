Got a few emails from them hitting on her.\n\nIt was seriously funny.\n\nThose were simpler times, weren’t they?",

I do a lot of writing, with an equal mix toward SEO-focused stuff like pillar pages and cluster content, and gated pieces like ebooks, guides, and white papers.\n\nMy first inclination when I read about this article was what you already gestured at. This feature has the potential to make tracking much more difficult for content marketers, which could in turn domino into greater challenges like proving ROI—something that can be difficult considering many content functions in companies today are understaffed and under-resourced.\n\nI suppose another question I have is, doesn’t a feature like this potentially render the entire practice of gating content obsolete? I know the wind is already blowing in that direction, but it feels like this announcement is accelerating that.",
