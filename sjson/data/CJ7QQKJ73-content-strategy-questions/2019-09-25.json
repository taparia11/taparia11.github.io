        "text": "Something I'm thinking about right now -- We want our blog to be primarily brand content that is insightful, valuable, and content that our current community is going to read and share _but_ I still need a place to publish content that is written primarily for search.\n\nIncreasingly, I think this content is too different to exist well together. Content that is optimized for the broad search goals of someone who has never heard from us before has a purpose, but it's never going to be content I want to put front-and-center. It's too general, and good search content often has a different tone and structure as well. It feels like it should be behind the scenes somewhere.\n\nDoes anyone have thoughts on this topic? Have you seen companies doing this well?",

One thing I would consider: \"Search vs. Brand\" content doesn't (or shouldn't) always mean \"Beginner vs. Advanced.\"\n\nYour brand can be your editorial standards, regardless of whether the topic is beginner, intermediate, or advanced.\n\nI use the encyclopedia analogy: Every general encyclopedia has an article on Amelia Earhart. They have to. No one is breaking new ground. The content of those articles overlaps by probably 95%.\n\n_But_ you may trust Britannica (clicking their result even when it's halfway down the SERP or starting your search on their homepage) to provide a well-written, trustworthy, up-to-date, and well-illustrated article about her (over, say, some poorly written, conspiracy-laden Wikipedia entry).\n\nThat's the real brand---not whether Britannica is or isn't covering basic or obscure topics but _the way_ that they cover them. If you can be consistent on that front, I think the question of whether beginner content is or isn't on brand fades a bit into the background.",

But some people wanted to keep it as its own URL because it was \"valuable.\"\n\nIf an idea is important enough to be central to our brand (and merit an editorial), we should find a way to incorporate that information into the core resource on the topic.

        "text": "Alright, who's up for a content x SEO discussion?\n\nHere's some open thoughts on content creation for the sake of ranking in search.\n\nModern SEO leans on a \"central\" page for a topic area, along with \"supporting\" pages. There are two well-known approaches for structuring content for a central page, and the query\/intent + current SERP results can tell you a lot about which one is a better fit. I've been trying to work out a formula of when to use which format (and I'm still testing).\n\nFirst, I see a lot of industry jargon thrown around in SEO and content: \"content pillars\" and \"hub and spoke\". To me, they're different formats. It's almost it's own rabbit hole to dive down, instead I'll see them as: Content pillars = long form pieces or 101 guides, and hub and spoke = table of content pieces.\n\nRight now, I believe those ambiguous search terms like \"applicant tracking\" where the SERP is a mix of definitions, articles, product pages, and more, need the guide style pieces. Where as targeted searches like \"how to start your own company\", where the SERP turns up primarily articles or blog posts, could be used for ToC pieces.\n\nJust an expansion upon this, and some analysis of content on the Shopify blog, we can see the use of both formats:\n\nFor guides, this blog `<https:\/\/www.shopify.com\/blog\/instagram-marketing>` ranks for a less specific but high traffic keyword \"instagram marketing\". When you dive into search insights and longer tail keywords on this topic, you can see that all folks are looking for is tips and strategies to use for their business—a thorough post or 101 guide (like we have provided) will do the trick to serve searchers what they're looking for. As we introduce other topics like hashtags, what to post on instagram etc. it allows us to link out to further articles that can target  other short tail keyword focused content in form of lengthy blogs or guides.\n\nFor ToC, this blog `<https:\/\/www.shopify.com\/blog\/ecommerce-business-blueprint>` ranks for a highly targeted, high volume term \"how to start an ecommerce business\". Why the ToC format works here is because actually answering that question would be so in depth that it would be next to impossible to include all that insight in one long form blog post. So, approaching answering this question would be best suited to writing this blog as if it were the contents page of book, i.e. understand the most vital areas surrounding the topic and send the reader on their way to the right \"chapter\" via an internal link to the content they seek.",

That, in turn, motivates Google to return several kinds of resources---indefinitely.\n\nAs a result, no matter which kind you create, there's greater risk as to whether it's the \"right\" kind, and you'll perpetually face higher competition: If an intent-ambiguous SERP includes three \"comprehensive guides,\" that means you have only three spots for yours (compared to a SERP of nothing but comprehensive guides, in which you likely have more places to land).",

All subpages link back to main \"hub\" page.\n\nFor some of our clients in the legal industry we're moving to this spider-like content model to rank for their primary local keywords.\n\nWhile we still employ a ToC on the hub page, we link out to separate pages as well to help strengthen the internal link profile of that page.",
