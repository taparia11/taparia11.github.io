        "text": "Hey Alex!!\n\nHere’s how we plan goals out at Soapbox org-wide and within marketing specifically (we’re a team of ~15 for added context):\n\n*Org wide:* \n• Founders set yearly goals\/targets around things like revenue, retention, the usual stuff you’d expect\n• From there, every team will work collaboratively to create their own departments goals (this isn’t just the marketing director telling the team “hey, these are our goals”, but rather the teams do this together. The department leader will ultimately drive and define the longer-term \/ big picture stuff, but everyone on the team has a say in how they’ll get there. We do this because it’s been a really great way to involve everyone in the goal-setting process and build a stronger culture of accountability and ownership \nFrom there, the entire company will work off of 2-week sprints. So, for marketing, during every sprint retro (happens on the last day of every sprint), we go through:\n• what got done\n• what got blocked (and why)\n• the plan for the following sprint\n• How we’re tracking against our goals\nFinally, we run a weekly company-wide town hall where our CEO shares our results (I.e. MRR, signups, etc) and does a quick dive into the insights behind the numbers.\n\nMain reason we do this every week is because it gives us 52 chances to “correct the ship”, like if a feature got pushed, a campaign was run, etc. It also helps us learn and iterate faster.\n\n\nHope that novel helps!!",
