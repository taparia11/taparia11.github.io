        "text": "Hey Allison, my contracts vary per situation, but I do include some common elements:\n\n• *Overview:* what we're doing\n• *Term:* start and end date\n• *Services:* scope--what I am, AM NOT doing, and what the client is responsible for\n• *Additional work:* how I handle\/charge for ad hoc or out of scope requests\n• *Fees:* what they're expected to pay, the pay schedule, and how they can pay\n• *Legalese*: clauses that protect me and the client\nThere are a few key areas I like to address (similar to Jessie above):\n• *Rollover:* if the contract is a retainer, I state the max hours I'll roll over (usually no more than 25%) and when they're expire (after 1 month)\n• *Pause clause:* if a client deliverable, such as payment or input, is late by 10 biz days, I can pause the project until I receive the deliverable. \nI'd don't know the specifics of your scenario, but it's helpful to remember boundaries don't just happen in a contract. Contracts are a super useful boundary-setting tool, but they're not your _only_ boundary-setting tool. Other useful tools:\n• Weekly check-ins or updates \n• Kickoff calls where you establish other boundaries, like communication\n• Invoices \n• Change of scope agreements (when the client wants to alter the original contract, document it) \nAnd it's also up to you to enforce these boundaries throughout a project. I'm saying this to myself as well because this is an area where I'm actively learning. :slightly_smiling_face: People are complex and so are relationships--including client relationships. Healthy ones take a good deal of work.",
