My agency is about 2.5 years old and majority of revenue comes from one big account based in San Fran, California. The account is very meticulous about safety, procedures and clean paperwork (normally) and they gave us a heads up that we will have to start paying taxes in US\/California based on the income from them.\nWe are HQ-ed in Europe (Slovenia) and what we are not super fond of is paying taxes twice (to Slo gov’t and US). Has anyone tackled this challenge before? What would you recommend - move the entire company to US? Thanks in advance!",
