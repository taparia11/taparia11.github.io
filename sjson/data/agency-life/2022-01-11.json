Very exciting!\n\nWe’re an amazing crew, but as many of you probably have experienced with working remote, it’s so easy to get caught up in the day-to-day and not really talk or connect much as a team beyond “Ok, what are we all working on today?” We do team lunches sometimes which are great, but I am trying to think of other ways to help us all better connect and create more of a “team” environment throughout the day, etc. \n\nI feel like in my role I have a real opportunity to help create this. Though, I don’t have a whole lot of experience in this regard. I was working in journalism before this, which was a hybrid office\/home model with a team where we all knew each other very well. \n\n*So, people who run\/work at 100% remote agencies or companies: What are some of the things you do to foster this? Thank you in advance.* :blush:",

        "text": "Great question! Our team at <http:\/\/foundationinc.co\/|Foundation> has been 100% remote since 2014 and has been intentional with the idea of fostering a true team vibe without an office -- I'll be the first to say:\n\n*The work is never done. You really have to show up and put in the work on culture \/ team vibe every single day and be thinking about it with every message you share and story you post.* \n\nSome of the ways that we've fostered this team dynamic and a way to connect better include:\n\n• *Monthly Games:* We run regular game sessions with the team on Zoom. In the past, I've hosted a remote Escape Room for the team and it was a massive hit. The team loved it (I'm also a camp counselor at heart so this was my dream job) and we've embraced games on the regular. We've done 21 questions which has provided some interesting dialogs + insights around one another. We have done Pictionary over Zoom (this was way easier when we were at 10 people). And other variations of games. \n• *Embrace Different Channels Of Interests:* We have a channel dedicated to Pets (kinda like here), Random, Movies, Music, Food, Sports, etc... People go where they're interested and have discussions on things outside of work. We've had intense debates about why Soup is a real food and should not be disrespected. \n• *Water Cooler App:* We have a water cooler app that prompts discussion with the team every week to discuss a random idea \/ question. It often results in more in-depth dialog with the team about things outside of work. \n• *Wired In Wednesdays:* We don't have any work specific meetings on Wednesdays. It allows the team to get into a state of flow. But it also allows the team to connect 1-1 as some colleagues have started to host their own 'office hours' where people just come together and talk about their careers, what they do, where they're going, how they manage their work, etc... \n• *Loom Videos:* We send Loom videos to one another often as a form of human communication. We're written word by default but often use Looms to communicate messages that are elevated with the human \/ face \/ voice behind it. Sometimes people will share Looms just talking about their favorite album and why it's so good... Sometimes people will share Looms debunking who shot Tupac... It's weird. It's fun. It's human. \nHope that helps!",
