We have a clause that says:\n\n_SEO-related Services are purely based on theory of current search engine algorithms and best practices, and FCM does not guarantee the effectiveness of Services for increasing search engine rankings._\n\nThat's there mainly to cover our asses in case something goes wrong, the client is asking:\n\nWe would like to see accountability on Flying Cats' to add a KPI on expected *Traffic - New Users* to this clause* *and remove\/edit this current term. Your teams have made estimations on the traffic potential in the proposal and following advice, we would need to see this outlined in this contract under Clause Eight.\n\nWhat would you do in this case?",
