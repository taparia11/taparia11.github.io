A few things come to my mind:\n• Carefully curate whom you connect with and actively invite Ideal Customers (you are already doing)\n• Engage with your Ideal Customers by liking their posts and commenting on them. Especially, if they are not hardcore on Linkedin, you will stand out as one of the few comments. Also, don’t be afraid to tag them on your posts or other people’s post IF the post is super insightful and relevant to them.\n• If they visit your profile, don’t be afraid to send a friendly DM to check in with them.\n• Other marketers and C-level executives might have different needs in terms of content. I started by posting SEO tips and _surprise_ attracted other SEOs as followers. Now, I am trying to post more strategic questions that a CMO, VP Growth would ask themselves (not other SEOs).\n• Create a group of friends in the similar industry and support each other by posting\/commenting on each other posts to increase visiblity. I also don’t think a daily post is necessary on Linkedin sine the half life of a post is much longer. Engagement really matters and I try to post less and get more engagement. Curious on other peoples thoughts here!\n• Do active ABM campaigns: Whom of your Ideal Customers could you interview for your blog, include in a guest post or feature on a webinar\/podcast? Reach out to them about that to build the relationship before pitching a sales call.\nCheers! :slightly_smiling_face:",
