I'd like to suggest that if you have to bribe people who are already getting paid for the work to get them to perform according to the agreement (a la the raffle you proposed), then you're either not paying them enough to make the job attractive OR they're just not good contractors and you should move on and find new ones.  Similarly, I think you're probably wasting your time to give writers a checkmark on the chalkboard and detention when they get three. If they're late without being a good communicator about it, you should dismiss them. You're running a business, not an elementary school. :slightly_smiling_face:",
