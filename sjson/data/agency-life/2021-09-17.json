The early model was based on keeping overhead as low as possible. Writers\/reporters were paid hourly -- so those costs could expand and contract along with the volume of work. Fast forward to today: The founder, who is still the majority owner, is largely retired and the three partners in my generation (mid to late 40s) are now running the company along with two other senior folks. We have grown -- and professionalized our operations -- substantially over the years, but we hang onto some of the practices (and mindset) from the company's origins, and we're starting to wonder if they're impeding our growth.\n\nTo wit:  We still pay everyone -- including ourselves -- hourly. We have literally never \"hired\" someone for a full-time \"job\" -- we typically try people out and develop them slowly over time.\n\nThe challenge: Our senior team is maxed out, and we need to bring in someone(s) else at our level - mid- to later career, with great editorial &amp; client management skills. The more we think about this, it seems unlikely that such a person would be willing to make this commitment w\/o the offer of a full-time job with standardized benefits. At the same time, committing to that fixed cost would be an enormous shift from how the company has been run for the last 25+ years.\n\nI realize this is a very specific problem, but I'm wondering if any of you have faced similar hurdles as your agency has grown. If so, how did you think through the risks and the opportunities? Any advice to offer?",

            "text": "TL;DR: How do you manage the leap from small, scrappy agency-of-freelancers to a more mature, growth-oriented agency?\n\nThe editorial agency where I'm one of four partners was founded in 1993, by a solo freelancer who had too much work to handle himself. The early model was based on keeping overhead as low as possible. Writers\/reporters were paid hourly -- so those costs could expand and contract along with the volume of work. Fast forward to today: The founder, who is still the majority owner, is largely retired and the three partners in my generation (mid to late 40s) are now running the company along with two other senior folks. We have grown -- and professionalized our operations -- substantially over the years, but we hang onto some of the practices (and mindset) from the company's origins, and we're starting to wonder if they're impeding our growth.\n\nTo wit:  We still pay everyone -- including ourselves -- hourly. We have literally never \"hired\" someone for a full-time \"job\" -- we typically try people out and develop them slowly over time.\n\nThe challenge: Our senior team is maxed out, and we need to bring in someone(s) else at our level - mid- to later career, with great editorial &amp; client management skills. The more we think about this, it seems unlikely that such a person would be willing to make this commitment w\/o the offer of a full-time job with standardized benefits. At the same time, committing to that fixed cost would be an enormous shift from how the company has been run for the last 25+ years.\n\nI realize this is a very specific problem, but I'm wondering if any of you have faced similar hurdles as your agency has grown. If so, how did you think through the risks and the opportunities? Any advice to offer?",
