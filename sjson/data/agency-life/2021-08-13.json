In the past, I’ve let people get away with submitting stuff late. But now, I’ve been onboarding a lot of new writers to the point where it doesn’t make sense for me to let poor performers get away with not being team players.\n\nSo my question — how to you both incentivize a team of writers to get stuff in on time (or at minimum, communicate changes in availability before a deadline is missed) and disincentivize\/punish writers who are consistently late without communicating before a deadline is missed?\n\nShould I be considering some kind of raffle reward for everyone who doesn’t miss a deadline in a month? What amount\/prize type is worth being consistently on time? And on the other end of things… how would you create a strike system and what would the different levels of “punishment” be on the way to, say for example, three strikes?\n\nOr is there another way of thinking about this that I’m not considering and should?

We put the schedule out 2 weeks before any due dates in the following month, so they have time those 2 weeks to say, \"I can't make this deadline.\"\n\nWe then requested that all missed deadlines have to be emailed to your editor with an explanation BEFORE the date is missed. When we explained this to the writers, we tried to communicate how it just cascades down to every client and every member of the team, which is why that accountability is now required.\n\nWe don't have a strike system (the strongly worded email seemed to have the intended effect) but I'd recommend something like \"After 3 missed deadlines in a rolling 6-week period, your contract will be closed. After 2 missed deadlines without explanation, your contract will be closed.\"\n\nWe send new writers feedback every week for the first 4 weeks they work with us, and then once a month afterwards with any necessary changes to their writing that have been noticed. That's when we bring up any missed deadlines. For us, it all came down to consistently communicating so that ending a contract wasn't a surprise.\n\nI'd also make sure that any strike system is written into your Independent Contractor Agreement. It should be clear that this isn't a freelance job where deadlines are malleable, though exceptions can be made in emergency situations.\n\nFor incentivization, we did start highlighting a \"freelancer of the month\" in an internal email newsletter every month. They get a gift card to their favorite coffee shop when they're chosen. But in general, I wouldn't incentivize missing deadlines because that communicates that missing deadlines is the baseline expectation and hitting them is worth an additional reward. The reward should be getting paid for your work.\n\nI'll also be fair here and say that I have an editor and head of people ops that handles these communications (<@U029CJ26CR0>). If I had to do it all myself, I'd literally just drop freelancers who were chronically late (and have done so in the past).",
