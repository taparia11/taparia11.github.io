I am a team of one with help from coworkers and freelancers, but my boss has asked me to start thinking longterm about how I will grow the team and formalize our process (from the content itself to when we hire vs contract, what elements of \"content\" fall under my team, like does email, does ad copy, etc) and I'm a bit at a loss as to where to even start with this. Documenting and formalizing the process of planning and creating content itself is the easy part and I can do that, but with the rest, I am not even sure as to how to start thinking about this",
