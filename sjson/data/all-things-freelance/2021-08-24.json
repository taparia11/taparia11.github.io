I think I would rather stick a pineapple up my butt than do that. The real joy I get from my work is from being quite involved and having long term relationships with clients, and because I work with time-poor \/ cash-rich manufacturers, they typically want to completely offload their marketing onto someone else rather than consider a DIY option.\nJust curious what others have done to increase their earning capacity past the 'x hours in a day' limit?\nThanks!",
