I've reached out to so many calls for freelance writers for a rate of $0.20\/word and legit get ghosted. \n\nMany of those companies are also tech companies expecting some technical language, which can take up a bit more time to get right compared to writing longer pieces that are iterations of \"The Guide to XYZ\" but still assume they can pay $0.10\/word. Well, okay, but they get what they pay for in that case. \n\nI work with a freelance writer at my FT role and he charges per project, but ad hoc his prices are $1\/word. It's still worth it for us and he's damn good at what he does because of his product marketing background.",

I've reached out to so many calls for freelance writers for a rate of $0.20\/word and legit get ghosted. \n\nMany of those companies are also tech companies expecting some technical language, which can take up a bit more time to get right compared to writing longer pieces that are iterations of \"The Guide to XYZ\" but still assume they can pay $0.10\/word. Well, okay, but they get what they pay for in that case. \n\nI work with a freelance writer at my FT role and he charges per project, but ad hoc his prices are $1\/word. It's still worth it for us and he's damn good at what he does because of his product marketing background."
