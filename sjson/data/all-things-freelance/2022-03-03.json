I've had some just be rude, and nasty and leave remarks that are akin to bullying. After a while (and a LOT of editors\/clients), I just try not to be married to anything anymore. I'm writing for a client, they are paying ME to do a service, and if it isn't what they want - fine - edit away. I typically ghostwrite, so if they want to edit? Go to town. Go crazy. Their name is on it. If I were to get bent out of shape over every edit, and nasty remark, I would curl up and hide in a closet in no time. The trick is to know your worth, and know that sometimes what you provide to one client, just doesn't stack up with another client. It doesn't mean you are a bad writer. It just means you didn't particularly write something that the client wanted at that moment in time. I've also weeded out almost ALL of my nasty\/edit-heavy clients. I've been fortunate to be able to only have the ones that love my work and give me creative liberty\/flex. I DO have one client who is a heavy editor- but the edits are good, and I use them as a learning experience. I think that your \"imposter syndrome\" can be dulled if you take those edits, or questions that come from clients and use them as learning experiences. I would also suggest to, take the term \"imposter syndrome\" out of your vocabulary. If you are writing and this is your career - you are not an imposter. You are a writer. Period.",

I've had some just be rude, and nasty and leave remarks that are akin to bullying. After a while (and a LOT of editors\/clients), I just try not to be married to anything anymore. I'm writing for a client, they are paying ME to do a service, and if it isn't what they want - fine - edit away. I typically ghostwrite, so if they want to edit? Go to town. Go crazy. Their name is on it. If I were to get bent out of shape over every edit, and nasty remark, I would curl up and hide in a closet in no time. The trick is to know your worth, and know that sometimes what you provide to one client, just doesn't stack up with another client. It doesn't mean you are a bad writer. It just means you didn't particularly write something that the client wanted at that moment in time. I've also weeded out almost ALL of my nasty\/edit-heavy clients. I've been fortunate to be able to only have the ones that love my work and give me creative liberty\/flex. I DO have one client who is a heavy editor- but the edits are good, and I use them as a learning experience. I think that your \"imposter syndrome\" can be dulled if you take those edits, or questions that come from clients and use them as learning experiences. I would also suggest to, take the term \"imposter syndrome\" out of your vocabulary. If you are writing and this is your career - you are not an imposter. You are a writer. Period."
