The 2-3 sentences per subhead is a good standard outline. And writing an outline where 70% of the copy ends up in the final draft is an anomaly. I have seen that with one client—an agency who has an in-house editor prepping outlines that tends to go quite verbose—but it’s the rare exception, and not the norm. I think you’re well within bounds to share your concerns and opt out if it’s not what you’re looking for. That’s an incredible amount of work for a strategist to take off a writer’s shoulders, and if you aren’t being compensated for it, no way.",

It seems like they expect you to handle all the research as well as outline development, which usually falls under the writer’s responsibilities in my experience. The 2-3 sentences per subhead is a good standard outline. And writing an outline where 70% of the copy ends up in the final draft is an anomaly. I have seen that with one client—an agency who has an in-house editor prepping outlines that tends to go quite verbose—but it’s the rare exception, and not the norm. I think you’re well within bounds to share your concerns and opt out if it’s not what you’re looking for. That’s an incredible amount of work for a strategist to take off a writer’s shoulders, and if you aren’t being compensated for it, no way."
