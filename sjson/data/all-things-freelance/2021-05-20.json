I havea question that maybe some of you have run into: I recently started sending my client invoices. I'm in Germany and the client is in Italy. I also do some freelance teaching (ESL) at the local university. When I invoice the school, I have a fiscal ID number that was assigned to me so I can get paid and I can't use this number for other purposes. I also pay German taxes, jointly, and I have a number for that. My Italian client asked me to provide a Fiscal ID on the invoices I send. I'm not a German Gewerbe, but I am considered a Kleinunternehmer in the freelance\/freiberufler domain. I'm also an American.  If I use my passport number as a fiscal id, that may cause me problems down the road. Can anyone give me some advice on what I can do to get a fiscal ID number for my client in Italy? Do they assign a number to me? If so, why is the bookkeeping department asking for a fiscal id number? (I don't provide enough services to collect VAT for the German Finance Ministry, so I don't have that number I can use.)\n\nThanks for the leg up. Wishing everyone a miraculous day!",
