This is one of the things where I experienced  dissatisfaction.\n\n- It'll be worthwhile to have them share with you how they'll measure the performance upfront - before you start work, so you have a chance to decide whether you want to sign up for them\n\n- How often will the bonus be paid, because results like conversions take time to show. This is the other thing I got my hands burned with.\n\n- Feedback meetings will be essential so that you get a chance to improve and work towards getting that bonus. I'd recommend discussing this as well.\n\nIn addition to this, I'd like to share my opinion on this model as well. Apologies if this is of no value to you. But I'll take the chance. My experience with such a payment model made me question what the incentive of the client is to give me the bonus.
