The information for the presentation will be provided in many different formats (slide deck, documents, etc.).\nYou will determine the flow of the presentation, what information should be on each slide, and the script that will accompany the visuals.\nYou will use our branded slide deck and there will be between 30-50 slides. The creative team will review the deck for formatting, etc. (the emphasis is on the content within the slides and script, not on visuals). When complete, the team will record these presentations and provide the videos to partners so they can earn these certifications.",
