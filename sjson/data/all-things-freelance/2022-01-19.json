Sometimes I end up working more than 8 to 9 hours at my full-time job and barely have the brain juice to create content for my freelance clients.\n\nI changed my way of working as a freelancer, wherein I started requesting a list of tasks\/articles to be written a week in advance.\n\nFor example, I would say, have a list of 6 articles to be written in a week. So then I can calculate how many hours will I need to invest per article and accordingly work around that without affecting my full-time job.\n\nIt's still a struggle, but hey, it pays the bills haha!",
