That got my up and running with a decent amount of referral work.\n\nThen about 18 months after that I started doing a lot of content marketing - posting on linkedin and sending out a newsletter (was monthly, then fortnightly, now weekly). That has been very valuable for keeping me top of mind with people - often someone will see a post I do on Linkedin, follow me, then hire me 18 months or more later.  Without the content marketing they would forget about me.\n\nDownside of that approach has been that there's been lots of work keeping me busy, but it's been all sorts of different things. Not a lot of specialising.\n\nSo, this year i've decided to focus on two things: Home pages and landing pages. This is going to involve a lot more outreach, as my offer is more narrow now. Haven't started doing that yet tho, as am fairly busy at the moment.\n\nI do not bother with SEO at all. I have a website, but the main search term is my name. When someone finds my website by searching \"copywriter nz,\" they are invariably a bad fit, and I never get any actual work. I'd recommend really focusing on your name being the valuable thing people want, so they search that, rather than chasing Google trying to get the worst customers in the world by optimising for an industry level keyword. Just my opinion tho.\n\nLMK if you have any more questions - I love talking about this stuff.",
