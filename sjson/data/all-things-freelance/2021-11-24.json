This feels more like an accounting detail vs anything else. Say you scope to $4,000 project fees. Quote 'em 40 hrs @ $100\/hr. Make it clear you won't be providing timesheets, as this breakdown was simply to appease their process.\n\nYou could expand that your current opportunity too. \"I only do per project, but I can give you an hourly equivalent for your processes. Please be advised that since I do work on per-project basis, there will be no timesheets involved, and I will be billing to estimate, not actual.\"\n\nIf you run into the nickel n diming over \"well this shouldn't have taken X hours\" you just reiterate that you're billing to estimate, not actual. Get that kinda wording into the contract :slightly_smiling_face: Have the paper trail that explains why you bill to estimate when charging hourly. Functionally, it's the same as a flat rate.",

Make it clear you won't be providing timesheets, as this breakdown was simply to appease their process.\n\nYou could expand that your current opportunity too. \"I only do per project, but I can give you an hourly equivalent for your processes. Please be advised that since I do work on per-project basis, there will be no timesheets involved, and I will be billing to estimate, not actual.\"\n\nIf you run into the nickel n diming over \"well this shouldn't have taken X hours\" you just reiterate that you're billing to estimate, not actual.
