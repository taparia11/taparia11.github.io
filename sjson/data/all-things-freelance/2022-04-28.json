        "text": "Hey James! Not sure if this is helpful advice or not, but my pricing process would be to roughly estimate how many hours it’s going to take me for the whole project, add a little padding for communication and uncertainty (something will take longer than you expect), and then just multiply it by an hourly rate you’re comfortable with and present it as one price (without the hours breakdown).\n\nI don’t know this industry specifically, but you can probably charge anything from $75-150+\/hr (assuming you’re doing quality writing of course!). I’m sure there are people who charge way more than that, but it’s all about your comfort level, how much value you feel you’re adding, and what’s fair to you.\n\nIf you’re super uncertain about how long it will take you and you’re worried about taking on too much personal risk, you could propose an hourly rate with a maximum budget. i.e. “I’ll do this for $100\/hr, up to 100 hours. If it’s going to exceed that, I’ll get budget approval before doing more work.” I’ve done that with a client before on a really weird project, but it’s normally better to avoid talk of hourly :stuck_out_tongue:",
