React-Testing-Library\n2. Jest\n3. Cypress (for integration tests)\n4. Cypress + Cucumber: Cucumber is a software tool that supports behavior-driven development, which allows non-programmers to implement tests.\n\n• How to install these libs?\n• What are good testing practices?\n1. Testing the behavior is better than testing the implementation itself.\n2. To avoid carrying out tests in a biased way and to manipulate a situation just for the test to pass, understanding that the test does *not* know its inserted context is super important.\n3. Searching for content created by the creators of the lib\/framework.\n\n• Where to get documentation?\n1. Google\n2. Lib repository on GitHub\n3. Content created by the creators of the lib\/framework like blog posts\n\n• Is it difficult to test in React? Are there easier libraries to test?\n    ◦ No, maybe junior developers have a hard time, but testing behaviors, whether things are on screen, etc., isn't that much harder than coding components.\n*Description*\nDevelopers often have a hard time implementing tests in React because there isn't so much content about it on the internet. Most of the time, only the frameworks\/libs documentation is not enough.\n\nThe most practical alternative to solve this type of problem is to be inspired by open-source codes on GitHub that perform similar functionalities.\n\nAs React is one of the most used libs, other libs\/frameworks won't be good enough for testing. Some issues appear when, in specific cases, there is no study material. To decide which libs\/frameworks to use, you should look at how many downloads it has, if it's still supported, and when it was last updated.\n\nEven though it is not very hands-on, this should be a tech post focused on developers.\n\nReferences\n• <https:\/\/www.cypress.io\/blog\/2021\/04\/06\/cypress-component-testing-react\/>\n• <https:\/\/charles-stover.medium.com\/behavior-driven-react-development-with-cucumber-faf596d9d71b>\n• <https:\/\/docs.npmjs.com\/downloading-and-installing-packages-locally>\n• <https:\/\/betterprogramming.pub\/libraries-vs-frameworks-whats-the-difference-5f28c53dcffe>\n• <https:\/\/kentcdodds.com\/blog\/common-mistakes-with-react-testing-library>\n• <https:\/\/medium.com\/@dev.cprice\/stop-testing-implementation-details-77a3528336af>\n\nDM me to discuss about deadlines and charging if you're interested :))",
