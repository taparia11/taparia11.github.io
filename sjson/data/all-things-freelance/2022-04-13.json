They usually ask me to take the late fee off and pay me right away, which I will do on the first offense. If it keeps happening, I’m probably going to stop working with them. I also know of a contractor who offers a 2% DISCOUNT for any invoices paid within 10 business days. If you’re having cash flow issues and timeliness is more important than the total amount, that could be a tactic to try!",
