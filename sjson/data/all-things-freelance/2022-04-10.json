        "text": "I wouldn't allow staff writers to ever do this, or do this as a staff writer, because doing your own research helps you build domain expertise. And domain expertise generally makes you increasingly valuable.\n\nIt's not just about digesting info that someone else filtered. It's also about knowing what's in the landscape, good or bad, and having context. It's hard to develop such judgment well when everything is filtered through someone else, especially presumably filtered through someone greener or less expensive than you are.\n\nGood fintech writers with domain expertise can make well into six figures and equity, for instance. They also can become expert enough to do media intws and help build a company’s brand, as well as their own.\n\nHaving led a large content team and our having built spokespeople \/ subject matter experts from scratch, I know that original research and constant learning matter. The folks who get stuff fed to them, rather than actually doing the learning, can work as a stopgap. But they will never be as valuable as those who do their own research and learning.\n\nOf course, people prioritize differently. My POV is always about how to build long-term value that outstrips others’ and that gives you more (and increasingly better) career opportunities.\n\nFrom a company perspective, when you're competing to get someone booked as a domain expert, would you rather send someone who really knows their stuff or not? And how effectively do you think that person will compete against other experts whom news outlets and shows can book? When it comes to story ideas, who do you think will come up with better ones — people who are doing their own research or not?\n\nFrom the perspective of booking guests and finding sources: As someone who used to work in news (like CNN, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal), I can easily ask questions and tell when someone doesn't really know a subject. Plus, we used to compare info from different sources to suss things out.",

(I know bc I shaped the role from scratch and I stay on top of the job market at all times, for myself and for hiring purposes.) But a world-class venture capital firm recruited me for months to attempt something ambitious, something that no other company has achieved yet. And the VC firm had the commitment and resources to attempt it, which was rare. Also, relatively few editorial people ever get to see behind the scenes how high-caliber VCs think and work. I wanted to experience that. Plus, if I wanted to return to fintech eventually, what was going to stop me?\n\nI've been recruited by other top VC firms, but they usually want to do vanilla content marketing and such. My current employer is much more visionary and risk-taking. Personally, I avoid jobs that don't include risk and discomfort, because you can't grow much when you play things safe.",

(I know bc I shaped the role from scratch and I stay on top of the job market at all times, for myself and for hiring purposes.) But a world-class venture capital firm recruited me for months to attempt something ambitious, something that no other company has achieved yet. And the VC firm had the commitment and resources to attempt it, which was rare. Also, relatively few editorial people ever get to see behind the scenes how high-caliber VCs think and work. I wanted to experience that. Plus, if I wanted to return to fintech eventually, what was going to stop me?\n"
