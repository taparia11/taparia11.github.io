Middle ground—sort of depends on how the politics of the industry work. If you position yourself as an agnostic NICHE-X expert, then I'd include known _names_ on a public portfolio for sure. Whether you showcase the work itself may need some throttling. I'd maybe summarize the projects, showcase results, and include enough detail that lets on that you know the space and the lingo. If people want examples, maybe have a few generic pieces available vs. actual work.\n\nYou want to be neutral party, so your own clients needs to know that you're not going to send a competitor an example of THEIR stuff to try and get more business :slightly_smiling_face:",
