On several occasions, I noticed that when I used relatable stories, actual product screenshots, and layered on how people similar to the target audiences of our readers used the product to solve their problems, we got new signups directly from people consuming the content.\n\nIt validated what we already know. And this is that it’s better to show (and not tell) people things.\n\nSeeing that it works, I’ve since developed frameworks for executing SaaS content marketing with Product-Led Storytelling.
