An impression unfairly influenced by anything from how the candidate looks, to whether they went to an Ivy League College, or worked at a Fortune 500 company. \n\nLike all biases, confirmation bias can affect your organization in several ways. It can limit diversity efforts, employee creativity, productivity, and in turn, business performance.\n\nIn fact, confirmation bias can be the foundation and enabler for several types of hiring bias. Gender bias, subgroup bias... \n\nSadly, even tiny amounts of bias in the hiring process can lead to huge financial losses. Research by Oregon State University indicates that as little as 1% of gender bias in hiring can lead to 32 additional failed hires and a $2.8 million per year loss in productivity for companies that hire 8,000 new employees per year.
