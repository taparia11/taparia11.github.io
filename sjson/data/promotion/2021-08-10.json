This time, I get to nerd out via a metaphor about one of my favorite things: Coffee. :coffee: Specifically, this edition covers the unique ability of technical content marketing as a vehicle for both giving and telling something to your technical audience\/community. In it, I break down: \n• The matrix of telling, giving, selling, and hearing within RevOps \n• Why your content needs to be genuine and useful \n• How to think about your content as teaching at scale \n• How to use your content as a platform to give your community a voice \n• How to support your community-first content as it matures in organic reach \nThis was a fun one to write, and I had a lot of fun hashing out the matrix idea with folks over the last few weeks. Would love your thoughts! <https:\/\/bit.ly\/3jF1wq1>",
