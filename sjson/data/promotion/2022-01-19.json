Since the blockchain is public, anyone can build any dApp on top of it. PeakD and Ecency are great examples. If you log into one and post something, it'll show up on the other since they're both using the HIVE BC. They just present and organize the underlying info differently.\n\nDAOs are technically dApps since they're built on some sorta chain, but have added characteristics like governance. So, based on my fledgling knowledge: all DAOs are dApps but not all dApps are DAOs :sweat_smile:",

Since the blockchain is public, anyone can build any dApp on top of it. PeakD and Ecency are great examples. If you log into one and post something, it'll show up on the other since they're both using the HIVE BC. They just present and organize the underlying info differently.\n\nDAOs are technically dApps since they're built on some sorta chain, but have added characteristics like governance. So, based on my fledgling knowledge: all DAOs are dApps but not all dApps are DAOs "
