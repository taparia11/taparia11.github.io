                "text": "Hey! I'm Erin, and I'm a marketing director at The Predictive Index—a B2B SaaS startup that's made the Inc. 5,000 \"fastest-growing companies\" list 4 years in a row. Over the past three years, my team and I have generated MILLIONS in revenue by publishing the kind of research reports people actually want to read and share. And now I'm packing everything I know about research report creation into a course. For you. Because I like you, yo. I'll take you step-by-step through the EXACT playbook I use to create research reports ... like the 2020 Remote Work Report, which has driven $490,000+ in revenue (so far). I'll also answer all your burning questions: How do I get valid data? What if the data doesn't support the story I want to tell? Am I supposed to gate the report for lead gen? How do I project manage all the moving parts? Why is my butt itchy? (Well on second thought, not ALL of your burning questions.) If you know me from my LinkedIn posts, you know my content has an edge to it. So expect some sarcasm, and maybe a swear or two. And expect to walk away with the knowledge and confidence you need to start creating your own research reports.

Freelance content writers who want to add a high-ticket item to their service menu. What’s in it for me?Content marketers who can strategize, project manage, and write research reports are incredibly valuable to B2B companies. That’s because—if well-executed—research reports equal dolla dolla bills. And trust, you wanna be the person bringing in dolla dolla bills. That person gets internal promotions, client referrals, and a fat bank account.Why should I listen to you?I’ve been leading content teams for 6.5+ years now, first at a Boston-based content marketing agency, and now at a high-growth B2B SaaS company. As head of content, I helped launch a market category to land a $50M Series A. We use research reports not only to grow category awareness and adoption—but also to grow the company. My insights have been featured by the American Marketing Association, Content Marketing Institute, and the American Society of Journalists and Authors. I've written for many B2B SaaS companies including HubSpot, Drift, G2, Intuit, Greenhouse, and <http:\/\/Metadata.io|Metadata.io>. What will I learn in this course?You’ll learn how to create a marketing research report for B2B companies. You’ll learn to improve your process over time, based on data and learnings. And if you’re a freelance content marketing writer, you’ll also learn how to sell this high-ticket offer to clients.How much does it cost?For a limited time, you can pre-order the course for $109. After September 7, the price will increase to $150. That may seem pricey at first glance. But when you’re creating reports that generate hundreds of thousands of dollars, it’s pretty easy to negotiate a six-figure salary. And when you have proof that you deliver results, clients are more likely to sign that $10,000+ freelance contract.How long will it take to see results?If you need to deliver immediate leads to your sales team (like many of us do), you can start doing that on day one. If you follow my distribution advice, you could get ongoing results—leads and revenue—for a whole year or more! Can I create research reports on my own?To execute a research report according to my playbook, you need several skill sets working together: data analysis, writing, graphic design, web dev, and distribution. If you're a unicorn, you can create reports on your own. If you're a content marketer or writer, you can execute several pieces of the pie (e.g., project management, survey building, report writing, ad copy), and delegate or outsource the rest, depending on if you're in-house or freelance. Don’t worry, my course covers delegation and outsourcing.I’m in. Where do I sign up?Cool! Click the blue “I want this!” button to pre-order. I’ll email it to you on September 7, along with a smidgen of my undying love.",
