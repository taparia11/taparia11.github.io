They have e-commerce marketing technology that uses AI. As of now it's planned to be a hybrid event, hosted in person in Oslo, Norway but also streamed online. We'd love if you could come in person, but is not necessary and can be done online too. We're looking for speakers that:\n• Are senior e-commerce marketers or hold a senior position related to e-commerce marketing \n• Are familiar with AI website tools (or are opening to using them and understand their value)\n• Have experience with managing large e-commerce websites\n• Have a good social media presence on twitter or linkedin for their personal brand (so we can easily promote each other)\nWe are planning to do a lot of cross-promotion for this event, so we would involve you in that so that your company receives value from your participation. My client is also open to partnerships and potentially even free access to their e-commerce marketing technology. If you're interested or have any further questions, please feel free to email me at <mailto:info@asmarketinagency.com|info@asmarketinagency.com>",
