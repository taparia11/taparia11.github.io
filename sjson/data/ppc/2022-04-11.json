Years back when i just got into performance marketing, when i used to run web traffic campaigns and brand awareness campaigns and shiz and get 0 conversions i couldnt believe that our ads were so bad.

First on lucky orange i noticed that a99% of the users stayed on the page for exactly 7 seconds and performed the same action, when i got the IP report, i saw that the server the traffic was coming from was called \"Facebook Ireland\" took this up with Facebook support and they said Facebook will not accept the results of third party data.
