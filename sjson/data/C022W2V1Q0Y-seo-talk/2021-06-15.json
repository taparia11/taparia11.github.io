It’s true the drop started happening in April - or at least we recovered in March and April and then started trending down again after the boom in traffic during the pandemic.\n\nPer your suggestions:\n1. Good call! I have noticed that we lost some important keywords on big posts. Was putting off rewriting\/majorly updating posts in case the July algorithm update changes it all again - but if our post doesn’t answer the question searchers seem to want answered, it’s worth looking into.\n2. I’m not sure I know all of this lingo, but they are backlinks on sites with mostly higher domain rating than us. We could just have a lot of older backlinks that are lower quality. I will definitely bring this up with them though! \nI have also noticed our site looking weird on mobile. Will bring that up with our dev team and see if anything changed.\n\nThanks again!
