Then, apart from everything that was just said, I’d look at natural language processing tools and libraries (<https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/natural-language|google’s one is a great start>, in the Try the Api box, you can paste a lot before you get prompted to make an account), and try to see whether the overall article’s relation to the actual topic is high, or whether each of the paragraphs’ topic is correlated with the paragraph text For example, if i’m speaking in the article too much about car parts and my article topic is on car repairs and i want to rank for the latter, the salience gets scrambled. Here’s a cool short-ish guide on the topic - <https:\/\/www.gainchanger.com\/how-to-leverage-google-nlp-for-seo\/>.\n\nI wouldn’t go too crazy on that and start writing super robotic - that’s not good - just look at some of the paragraphs, what entities inside them are recognized, and overall - whether the article is qualified in the “right category”. Perhaps some of the wording takes it way off topic. Or as it was said above, we need to up the relevance and tools like Clearscope and Topic help with uncovering those. You can also plug the competitor articles into Google NLP tool to see what topics they are being related to. Then, it’s you who has to choose what exactly to change, knowing your niche and what makes most sense for your readers.",

Perhaps some of the wording takes it way off topic. Or as it was said above, we need to up the relevance and tools like Clearscope and Topic help with uncovering those. You can also plug the competitor articles into Google NLP tool to see what topics they are being related to. Then, it’s you who has to choose what exactly to change, knowing your niche and what makes most sense for your readers."
