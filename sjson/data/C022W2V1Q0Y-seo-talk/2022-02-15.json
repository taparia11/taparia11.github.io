Been implementing this for all the clients I've been writing for.\n\nOn new sites, this has helped take the featured snippet position for low and medium-difficulty KWs. This should help take this spot for high-difficulty keywords too once the article moves to page 1 of the results.\n\nSo, here’s the game\n\nSay, for example, the question is ‘Can dogs eat watermelon’ the answer target I would write is ‘Yes, dogs can eat watermelon. Watermelon is rich in water and nutrients such as vitamin A, B6, C, and potassium making it an excellent food for dogs. However, the seeds need to be removed to prevent any possibility of intestinal blockage’\n\nThat’s it!\n\nWhat's the logic behind writing such answer targets and why is it working?\n\n*DIRECT ANSWER*: We have directly answered the question with a ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. Google looks for this decisiveness in the answer. Google’s algorithm that decides the featured snippets isn’t very mature. It still looks for direct answers to questions\n\nWe have included the term ‘nutrients’ in the answer target. In *semantic SEO*, the term ‘nutrients’ would be the entity closest to deciding whether any food can be eaten or not. Include the term you believe would be most relevant to the question. You can also take a look at the existing answer target to find clues for this\n\nWe have also ended the answer target with a precaution. This makes it a complete answer for Google to rank\n\nWe have kept the answer target in the sweet range of *35-40 words*. Though this varies slightly based on the niche, 35-40 is the common range to use.\n\nTIP: Write the answer target right after the H1. If the answer target is written for an H2, it should be the first 2-3 lines right below the H2.",
