So I've been freelance writing for over 13 years, and I recently purchased the Guru plan of SEMRush for a one-off project I did for a client (big keyword and competitive analysis project) as well as build the author website for my latest book launch. I found it so helpful in what I do day-to-day as a writer (seeing how my content ranks and then using that for demonstrating value in future proposals), that I'm continuing the subscription. It's not cheap, however, and I'm wondering what I could possibly do to get more value out of it as a freelancer. Most of my clients provide me briefs that they've created from it, so the SEO work is already done. But for new clients or clients that aren't using tools, is there something a freelance writer could bring to the table having their own SEM Rush account? So far, it seems to have more of a value for people that advertise as agencies, and I'm trying to remain a freelancer at this point. I'm trying to justify keeping it -- even though I love it so much.",
