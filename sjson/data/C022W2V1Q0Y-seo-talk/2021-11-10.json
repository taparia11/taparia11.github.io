We sell it as an element of one of two approaches:\n\n• Topic Cluster Calendar\n• Total Addressable Market Gap (TAM-G)\nWe try not to focus on the spreadsheets and such as much and spend more time using that data to focus on things clients care about: revenue, costs, and time.\n\nKeyword research, by itself, is tough to sell because anyone with an Ahrefs or Semrush account “thinks” they can do it. \n\nWe couldn’t find success selling keyword research so we began focusing focusing on what makes our approach _*valuable*_.\n\n• Value = \n    ◦ (their dream × perceived likelihood of success) \/ (time delay × effort)\nIt’s often easier to decrease the variables in the denominator than it is in the numerator. If you can reduce the time delay (how long it takes them to get their desired result), you increase value. If you reduce the level of effort they have to put in, you increase value.\n\nFor the top two variables, we want those to increase. Either increase what they want (which can be a dicey situation to get into) or increase their _*perceived*_ likelihood of success by showing them case studies, testimonials, references, etc. \n\nWe focused on the bottom two and it’s worked great for us so far.\n\nFor example:\n\n• We have our own topic clustering algorithm that can cluster a thousand keywords in 300 milliseconds. We don’t pitch it like that but we do “wow” people by being so fast (meaning action can be taken fast). \n    ◦ The only thing that beats *free* is *fast*. If you can do something that’s fast, market it by showing how fast you can get someone results (e.g. How we helped DoNotPay increase their organic traffic by 350,000 in 30 days). This case study has the benefit of decreasing time delay while simultaneously increasing perceived likelihood.\n*Reduce Effort:* We map everything out for them into a clear to understand path forward. All they have to do is write content. We could reduce effort further by writing content for them but we prefer working with companies that already have their own writers.\n    ◦ There’s a step before this that involves financial projections and material to pitch executives.\n*tl;dr:* Don’t sell keyword research. Sell the result of it. Focus on increasing value by either reducing the time it takes to deliver or the level of effort they have to put in (DFY vs DWY vs DIY).",
