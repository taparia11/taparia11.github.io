We're looking to up our SEO game and we have a bunch of weak and missing keywords. The company is launching new stuff soon as well. My question is do we start using missing ones first or do we go with the weak ones and make them stronger with more content? (Plus, what metrics should I focus on - like searches, number of keywords on the competitor's website or CPC- Like what could be more important in this context where we're looking for more eyeballs) I'm not doing SEO for them but I need to figure this out since I'm usually ideating topics. (We're a super small team) I'd love your thoughts on this! \n\nPlus, what do you suggest should be our next steps in terms of getting noticed with SEO? \n\nThought: I've thought of using infographics to consolidate blogs into them since I'm into legal design (designing digestible privacy policies, terms of use, and simplifying stuff) so I thought that would be more logical to do. \n\nFinal Q: How many blog posts a month do you suggest for a growing company like that because I want them to see real results from my writing! This was a long one but I'm looking forward to your thoughts!!",
