The company in question is a project management training company that does have a head physical office, but offers training worldwide (as long as the time zones make sense, because the training is delivered in real-time). We do get a fair amount of traffic around the home base (Vancouver) so I think it's best to just let GMB do its job locally and rely on other marketing platforms for other locations. Thanks!",
