We don’t actively build links—they get approx. 1-2\/month, if that.\n\nWe decided to tackle a relatively large topic (90K SV) in December with buying intent:\n\n&gt; _best x for y_\n&gt; \nPublished the article on Dec 30th and began ranking on the first page (6-7) by Jan 4th. Ranking is holding steady so far and many long-tail variants are quickly climbing up page 2.\n\nThis has worked to break into different core topics successfully as well — for both B2C and B2B companies.\n\nWe developed an algorithm that identifies and prioritizes this for us now—making content planning and projecting results way easier and more reliable than it used to be.\n\nBut for everyone else, here’s how to approach it and still get some good results:\n\nFind the topics for which you already have first page (preferably top 3) rankings for.

We reserve this one for last so we’re aren't wasting time and budget building links just for the sake of building links.\n*Caveat:* You do actually need some content that ranking well before you can begin to benefit from the acceleration this provides.
