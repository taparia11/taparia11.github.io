We are using a background image for the top section of the page where the main heading, subheading and a couple of call to actions are displayed. The background image doesn't resize well for mobile but it looks good on desktop. So we decided to clone that section, remove the background and display it on mobile. So now the original section is displayed only on desktop, tablet landscape and the cloned section is displayed only on mobile.\n\nThe doubt I have is, when we cloned the section, there are now two H1 headings of the same name, one that's displayed only on desktop and another only on mobile. Do you think that's okay with regards to SEO or should I try something else?",
