They are not sure, however, whether to house this content on their family of brands site (a well-performing, mid-ranked site of over 15 years that gets good social traffic from places like Pinterest, as well as does well on many terms they want to rank but features content for all of their brands, so not exactly focused) OR their new site, which has a nice, focused URL and mission statement, but lacks all the years of backlinking, etc. If they plan to put a lot into this content plan is it better that they focus on a single niche or build on existing wins? I've heard it both ways from experts and peers I've consulted with, but since there's a risk that the niche site is single-product focused (and products do cease to be after some time), I think it's risky to go that route and ignore all the SEO wins they have with the older, more established umbrella site. Thoughts?",
