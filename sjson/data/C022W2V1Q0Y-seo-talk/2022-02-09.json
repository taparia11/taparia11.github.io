        "text": "That approach sounds like a waste of time and money. When it comes to link building is all about quality over quantity.\nJust look at the Ahrefs metrics if you’re unsure of some sites. Here are some of the most important factors to look for:\n\n• The site should be in a related industry and rank for relevant keywords. You can use Ahrefs -&gt; Organic keywords to check this. \n• Minimum DR 7+ and 1000+ minimum traffic. Traffic is more important than DR\n• The links should be Follow\n• There should not be a big raise in traffic followed by a big dip according to Ahrefs\n• Should not have “Write for us” type of pages\n• No PBN’s (these are not always easy to identify but if the design looks cheap and they don’t seem to be a real business it’s likely they are part of a PBN network)\n• Avoid sites with manipulated metrics. You can identify these based on their backlinks profile. E.g., their backlink profile looks sketchy, and\/or they get links from lots of Google properties e.g., <http:\/\/google.de|google.de>, <http:\/\/google.es|google.es> etc. You can investigate this in Ahref → Backlink profile → Referring Domains → Filter by Follow.\n• Should be single niche focus around your business (exceptions could be made for the right sites)\n• Should not be a public sale e.g also found on link marketplaces\n• Traffic should come mainly from from USA (we could make a few exception for international sites focused on business)\nThen I really question the approach of pointing the links to your features pages. You might want to rank your product use case pages and other education based articles.",
