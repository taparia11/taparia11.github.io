I'm looking for a new opportunity to help an organization grow its brand, attract and engage new audiences, and acquire customers through the optimized content and digital experiences I create. I run the gamut in terms of long form and short form, as well as thrive in places where I can build and nurture a team of writers, producers, and designers to manage websites and content. I'm in the SF Bay Area, but am looking for something remote. More about me here: <https:\/\/merryrichter.com\/> and here <http:\/\/linkedin.com\/in\/merryrichter\/>. Hope to hear from you with any relevant opportunities and\/or tips about great recruiters who can help me find unadvertised roles. Thanks in advance!",
