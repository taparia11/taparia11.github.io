I've created over 100 hours of television and my work has spanned networks like: MTV, Bravo, VH1, Food Network, Discovery Plus and more. I take a multifaceted approach: I am constantly working on new development concepts, on-going productions, and current edits for content already filmed. As a 'Senior Story Producer' I am looking at the individual character and creating compelling story points around their journey, if I'm given a concept I am casting authentic people and following their stories, connecting them to the brand.  At the moment I am collaborating on a documentary about MDMA-aided therapy - this is in the early stages of production and I've been working on the language and pitch deck design so Fix Films can present the documentary to capital investment firms.",
