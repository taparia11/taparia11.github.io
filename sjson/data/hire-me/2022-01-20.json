I'm looking for new work in the fashion industry :dancer::man_dancing:\n\nThe amount of fashion I see online especially because I'm in a target demographic has me really thinking about who makes what, who owns what, and who buys what. I've always liked the fashion industry as a consumer but I'd like to play my part in it as a professional too.\n\nIf you want to offload work and have any clients\/contacts looking for work, please connect with me (via DM or at <mailto:amandahoyer2@gmail.com|amandahoyer2@gmail.com>)",
