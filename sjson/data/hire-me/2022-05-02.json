I've edited over 40 articles and over 30 book manuscripts. \n\nI also have experience collaborating with others to produce content. I have worked with B2B SaaS marketing teams of my clients' companies (including <http:\/\/Copysmith.ai|Copysmith.ai> and Hopper HQ) to successfully write and edit drafts. \n\nI've coordinated a remote team of content developers to execute a content production project. I regularly gave constructive feedback which helped them improve their writing. I reviewed their work, found gaps, and explained what they needed to improve. \n\nI also have a good understanding of SEO. I've taken several courses on search optimisation and also applied what I have learnt to posts I have written in the past. I am still open to learning more.\n\nI have excellent knowledge of Canva. I created graphics designs for online content and trained over 60 people to use it. Find attached samples of a design I made with Canva.\n\nI also have experience writing and I authored several books about technology,  learning and work. I am as comfortable editing a manuscript as I am writing a blog post from scratch. \n\nI also enjoy learning and investing time in developing myself. \n\nI am open to editing and B2B SaaS longform writing work.
