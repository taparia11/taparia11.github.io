I am looking for visionary clients to help build their brand story from brand strategy to creative direction (sourcing and managing identity designers) to creating robust thought leadership depending on the project. And sometimes it’s as straight forward as writing and listening to the stakeholders to write compelling copy throughout the funnel. I would love to work for a company that enables creativity - anything like an Airbnb to Etsy to Canva to anything in the visual or creative realm. Also love futurism and problem solving and am great at telling stories of breakout ideas and companies. Would love to hear from you!",
