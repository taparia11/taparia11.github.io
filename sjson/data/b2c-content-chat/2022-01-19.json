That's why it's called a funnel, most users will go through the stages in time. One of the biggest errors I see business leaders do is expect us to deliver sales or SQLs directly from the top of the funnel.\n\nFor example, with a simple 3-level funnel:\n• top-funnel content KPIs: traffic + clicking to read content that it's part of the next level\n• mid-funnel content KPIs: clicking on product descriptions (=bottom of funnel content)\n• bottom-funnel content KPIs: app installs, etc., whatever conversion means to your business\nFor this, you would need to categorize all your content per funnel stage and then aim for each piece to lead the reader to content belonging to the next stage in the funnel.\n\nThat's my view on this. What do you think?",
