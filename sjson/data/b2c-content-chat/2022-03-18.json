I agree that it's unlikely you'll get quality long-form responses on any consumer-oriented panel (Pollfish, SurveyMonkey, etc.) as people want to move quickly through those surveys and collect their reward. Long-form questions require thought. You'll get more thoughtful responses when you can reach out to the audience in a more organic fashion and they're answering because they trust the brand asking and are interested in the data themselves (so do offer to share your findings with them).",
