We're taking over an email list for a pretty well-known author which is great, but we have minimal historical data and a whole lotta dormant contacts in the database. One of the ways we're getting to understand the audience is by segmenting the list and sending some surveys. I'm aware just about everyone is sending surveys these days so we're going to be careful with the approach and be sure they get something out of it. My Q: Does anyone have angles\/concepts that worked for surveys re: getting people to actually fill it out? Thanks for any insights!",
