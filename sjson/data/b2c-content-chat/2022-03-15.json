I'm working on an owned data project and need a better way to collect long-form reviews.\n\nThe project involves running surveys and collecting reviews around job satisfaction in different sectors, then use the data to create structured \"how to become\" pages like this: <https:\/\/www.training.com.au\/role\/web-designer\/>\n\nThe last two rounds of this project, we ran our surveys on Typeform and Pollfish, but both have their limitations.\n• *Tyepform*: Quality long-form responses, but very difficult to get the number of responses we need. (even with a $20 incentive through Tremendous, which pretty much just ensured we were plagued by bots. We reached out to lots of Facebook Groups and subreddits, etc)\n• *Pollfish:* They source responses for you, at around $2 per respondent, plus comes with demographic information. But very poor quality long-form responses for the 'review' bit.\nHas anybody run anything like this on a different platform? I've looked at SurveyMonkey, but holy hell is that expensive. (Eg. $3000 for a 100-person survey, and I have no way of seeing if their longform response quality will be any better that Pollfish)\n\nAny suggestions appreciated :partyparrot:",
