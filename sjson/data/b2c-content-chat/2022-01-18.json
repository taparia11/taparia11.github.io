I report on a variety of channels and on metrics like traffic by channel, open rates for the newsletter, reach and engagement, follower growth. I am also good with anecdotes and drumming up positive feeling for our content program. However… I find myself hitting the same question. How do we know the content is helping the bottom line?\n\nI use Google Analytics\/GSC along with in-house data, SEMRush, Amplitude, Rockerbox, and AppsFlyer. I *can* see limited data around metrics like app installs, clicks to main website, and sign-ups, as well as a few direct conversions, but as it’s last-click, it’s not a great representation of the impact of blog and social content.\n\nHow do you go about gathering the content metrics you want?
