We are trying to target small business owners, hospitality industries managers, startups &amp; etc. Mostly a very corporate audience. We have a strong employee database so tips catering to employees do not drive lead generation which is our primary goal. I’m fairly new in content marketing and also knew to the work force (just 2 years strong) so this is proving a bit difficult for me. Any ideas please? I’d love to hear from y’all with more experience!",
